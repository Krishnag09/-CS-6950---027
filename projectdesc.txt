Thanks for checking out our project page.  We are grateful for everyone's incredible interest and support!
We've been diligently working since summer 2013 to develop ICLOAK‰ã¢, a portable online anonymity tool to give you a fast, convenient and flexible way to browse the Internet anonymously on any computer. 
We've done all the ground work and prototyping and now we need your help to take this baby to market and help folks take back their CHOICE about what's tracked about them and what isn't.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik is your superhero tool that turns any computer you use into a safe and trustworthy computer.  
We've combined a security hardened operating system with a secure web browser, encrypted password management and more, onto a USB drive so you can plug it into any machine (even the most unsafe and virus filled), reboot the machine and start browsing as if you took the time to build a custom computer built for security, privacy and anonymity from scratch! 
Once you finish browsing, unplug, reboot the computer again, and ICLOAK is designed so that no one will ever know you even used that computer.
Below are 3 versions of the product packaging card that we are considering. In the white box in the middle will be a small plastic box that contains the actual USB device below.

Like our t-shirts say... YOU ARE BEING WATCHED.  We are too.  All of the time.  Big Data, Big Brother, Hackers, Ex-Lovers, Employers, Marketing Firms, Stalkers, Identity Thieves, and on and on.  Every day there is another news report about how data is being collected on everyone.
To protect yourself the questions are...
HOW do you change your IP address so it is not tracked everywhere you go?
HOW do you change your Media Access Control (MAC) address so your computer cannot be identified?
HOW do you know if there is HIDDEN software recording your every keystroke on your computer?
HOW do you stop sites from tracking your browser Navigator data profile and tracking your browsing from site to site?
HOW do you protect yourself when you want to?
If you are like most average folks using the Internet every day, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO!  Don't feel bad... neither does anyone else who isn't an Uber Geek like us.
The trouble is, the technology around us has outpaced the normal person's ability to keep up with it all.  Because of this, few people have the knowledge or time to figure out ways to protect their privacy WHEN THEY WANT TO.
It's not always easy to find a computer you can trust.  Many machines have spyware and malware even the owners don't know about and their antivirus cannot detect!  So we asked ourselves, how can we turn every computer you will ever use into a secure and trusted machine when you NEED it?
We needed a way to bypass the computer's hard drive and software and yet utilize all its processing capabilities. This led us to the boot-from-usb method that's been around for a long time.
We figured, if we could somehow build in all the tools you need to browse the Internet securely and anonymously into a SINGLE portable USB drive that works on PCs, Macs, and Linux, we'd have managed to turn almost every machine on the planet into a secure and trusted machine you could use.
Whether you use a computer in the office or a computer at a cyber cafe in Bangkok you will be protected.
We have many ideas about what ICLOAK can do and we'll be working on adding them into the product in the future.  Right now, however, ICLOAK does the following things really well:
1. ICLOAK will mask your IP address.  Period.  All of your data traffic is forced over TOR or I2P anonymizing networks making you appear to be somewhere else than where you really are.
2. ICLOAK gives you the ability to choose a Country to appear to be coming from.  This has many uses including gaining access to content that is blocked in certain jurisdictions.
3. ICLOAK will automatically create a new, random MAC address (this is the hardware identifier for the device you are connecting with) every time you connect to any network.
4. With ICLOAK you can browse anonymously on any 64-bit Windows, Linux or Mac computer without needing to alter those machines.
5. It WILL NOT LEAVE ANY TRACE of your browsing activities on any machine you use.  No cookies, no browser history, no user ids, no log files.
6. ICLOAK Stik is immune to any sort of persistent infections so you will be safe from malware, spyware, viruses and any other malicious software each time you reboot.
7. ICLOAK Stik can store encrypted versions of any usernames and passwords you want to keep safe.  Also, it allows you to keep separate "identity sets" for keeping multiple identities separate from each other.
8. ICLOAK Stik can store files on a "visible" section of the USB drive that can be used to store files you want access to on your regular computer OS or transport from place to place.  (ICLOAK itself is contained in a section hidden from your regular OS).
9. ICLOAK Stik itself cannot store any information about you or what you do with it without your deliberate action.  So even if someone steals your ICLOAK Stik, there will be no information on it about your browsing activities.  NOTE:  If you store passwords, or other files on the unencrypted partition, only that information will be retrievable by someone else if they get your Stik.
Here's an infographic we put together to demonstrate how ICLOAK works.
Why iCloak?
There are literally dozens of these but we'll only list what we think are the top ten online threats ICLOAK can help protect you from:
1. Identity theft
2. Silent monitoring of your camera and microphone
3. IP address recording
4. Browsing and download history spying
5. Email hacking using malicious cookies and similar scripts
6. Screen captures
7. Password theft through spyware
8. Key-logging software that records your keystrokes.
9. Loss of funds through theft of credit card and bank details
10. Prevent websites from tracking, recording and selling your web usage data to advertisers.
So what's under the hood?
ICLOAK is a made up of both hardware and software components. 
Hardware: The hardware that will go into building ICLOAK is a robust and high quality USB drive manufactured by the largest manufacture of USB drives in the world, Kensington.
It's made from durable aluminum with no moving parts.
One of the things we want to ensure is that your ICLOAK Stik lasts at least 3-4 years with daily or regular use.  With periodic use we expect it to last up to 5 years or longer.
The USB drive is also small and very portable making it easy to carry with you wherever you go.  It is designed to easily slip on a keychain or in your pocket.  
Software:
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik
ICLOAK Stik will come with features to enable you to browse anonymously from any machine.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik will contain ICLOAK‰ã¢ Ring which can be used to store and manage your passwords securely.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik will also contain a separate partition for storage that your regular computer can access.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik PRO
In addition to giving you the ability to browse anonymously from any machine, ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik Pro will also come with additional software so you can:
Create/Edit Excel Spreadsheets in private
Create/Edit Word docs in private
Send/Receive anonymous messages
Store Bitcoins in a secure wallet
Store encrypted usernames and passwords
We are innovators and if there's one place innovation is recognized and supported it's right here on KickStarter.  We are here because we believe we have something that could help millions of people around the world take charge of their online freedom and rights.
ICLOAK is not just a gadget to us, it's an ideal, a philosophy, a statement that says we should have the right and the option to freely participate online. We are here because we hope to find kindred spirits who believe in what we are doing as much as we believe in it ourselves and in the GOOD of what we are doing.  
So jump on board, join a movement that is making a difference for average people everywhere and help us get to our next milestone!

Nope floats above the screen
Why not just use a piece of tape to cover the lens?
Tape loses its stickiness over time
Tape is easily forgotten, lost, or repurposed, leaving the camera exposed
Tape doesn‰Ûªt look very professional
Tape may leave a sticky residue
We started this project because we volunteer with students who use digital camera enabled devices.  The shocking truth is that just about anyone can hack into your  computer and turn on the camera without you even knowing it.  The only way to guarantee your privacy is to cover the camera when you are not using it.  We believe that it is your space, so you should be the one to decide when your camera is being used.  
The Nope features a subtle design which matches the beautiful aesthetic of top laptops and desktops. The magnet elegantly revolves around the base magnet like a planet revolving around the sun.
MacBook Pro 15" Glass Screen Closed with Nope
MacBook Air Closed- Nope does not obstruct laptops from closing
How does it work?
One magnet of Nope is attached to your computer with thin 3M VHB tape. The other magnet is held in place by attractive magnetic pull.  There is a thin space between the magnet and the computer, so the magnet does not touch the computer while moving or in place.  It partially levitates and only a small part is held by magnetism.  The magnetism is strong enough to hold and stay in place and not so strong as to damage or affect any electronics.
Black Nope
If you want to change your Nope or its location, it's a good idea to get extra tape.
Neutron S is from our last Kickstarter. We are offering it here for our backers for well below the $29.99 price on our website.

 Nope - Patent Pending
Simple, Secure & Anonymous.
Despite increasingly robust solutions from software giants in the antivirus space and the collaborative efforts of Internet security players - including government and private initiatives - no effort has succeeded in creating an impenetrable layer of security between a web browser and a computer or corporate network. Why? Incremental virus software improvements are not the solution. 
The only way to protect a machine or network from Internet-borne criminal mischief is to physically block its exposure to the Internet. How can a machine be physically blocked from the Internet and still be online?
Meet Webcloak‰ã¢
Webcloak‰ã¢ is a small USB device with a distinctive form factor containing a technical architecture that shifts the paradigm in web security by creating the most impenetrable barrier between a client machine and the Web. Featuring a game changing combination of hardware, encryption and "secure access" software, Webcloak‰ã¢ provides a physical shield that allows users to safely browse the Web while being protected from viruses, data theft or identity theft - it essentially makes you invisible.  With an incomparable configuration of hardware and software, Webcloak‰ã¢ not only protects your computer from Internet threats, but also protects you from hostile applications on the host computer - the product simply stops any incoming access to the host machine. Webcloak‰ã¢ does not install any software on your computer, you simply plug it in and the protection begins. No need to restart your computer, Webcloak‰ã¢ works without rebooting! When you shutdown Webcloak‰ã¢ there is no trace of it or your Internet activity left behind.
Webcloak‰ã¢ Protects You Against:
Also protects you from:
"SideJacking" - Wi-Fi Session Hijacking
Network Traffic Sniffing
DNS Spoofing
Key-loggers and Screen Scrapers
"Man in the Middle" Attacks
Site Visit Tracking Code
Cryptolocker and All Other Ransomware
All Viruses and Exploits
What Makes Webcloak‰ã¢ Unique?
WebCloak creates the most impenetrable barrier between you and the web. It‰Ûªs our mission to provide a completely safe, secure and anonymous online experience. In order to do so, we took a step back to view the whole picture: what currently exists in the realm of internet security, what are people doing, what works, what doesn‰Ûªt work and what‰Ûªs missing? Where are the holes? Where are the vulnerabilities? Most solutions focus on monitoring, detection and mitigation, meaning you‰Ûªve already been compromised, how can you minimize the damage? You have the wound, how can you stop the bleeding? Our goal is to make sure you never reach that point. Webcloak‰ã¢ uses a ground-up, combination of hardware, encrypted hardware virtualization and a game changing encrypted communications system coupled with a custom cloud enabled Internet desktop operating system.  You may have seen products on the market that claim to protect you while using the Internet by using encrypted thumb drives and "portable browsers" or bootable thumb drives and dubious free anonymity software. These products offer limited to no protection and can be difficult to use, all while providing a false sense of security which makes you more vulnerable.
How Does Webcloak‰ã¢ Work?
The device encases an "Internet desktop" running a secure virtual operating system. By plugging Webcloak‰ã¢ into your computer, it forms a "machine within the machine". Unlike conventional web browsing, with Webcloak‰ã¢ the Web is not able to identify or access your computer in any way, shape or form. Webcloak‰ã¢ protects information as it travels to and from the Internet using our SafeChannel message encryption system. All data is encrypted using a customized version of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption which is rated by the National Security Agency (NSA) as "Top Secret" level encryption, their highest rating. With Webcloak‰ã¢ do your banking and make online purchasing without fear of data theft, virus infection or vandalism.
Data is protected as it passes through the host system to and from the Internet.
Step 1: Plug Webcloak‰ã¢ Into Your Computer
STEP 2: Login
STEP 3: System is Secured
STEP 4: SafeWeb Desktop
PLAY

SafeWeb
SafeWeb includes a customized browser that uses our encrypted communications system, along with additional security features, to create a safe, secure and anonymous browsing environment. All of your Internet activity is encrypted as it passes through the host machine to the Internet. Your location and identity is masked by a secure proxy system. SafeWeb also includes your ‰ÛÏInternet desktop‰Û that provides access to our secure Internet applications ‰ÛÒ browse, chat and much more. New secure applications will become available to you as we add them to SafeCloud, our secure cloud environment.
PLAY

SafeVault
SafeVault is your secure, encrypted drag and drop file store that allows you to keep your most important files with you wherever you go, securely using top secret level encryption. Simply select files and drag them onto the Webcloak‰ã¢ application. You can also browse and search for files and folders, extract, rename and delete files on the Webcloak‰ã¢ device. SafeVault provides access to our SafeCloud secure cloud storage environment. Any files or folders that are created in the SafeCloud folder do not reside on the Webcloak‰ã¢ device, instead they are added to SafeCloud and are encrypted using top secret level encryption.
PLAY

SafeKeeper
SafeKeeper is your secure encrypted password keeper that allows you to store all of your passwords and account numbers on your Webcloak‰ã¢ device. When you want to access a site simply select the SafeKeeper entry and click the link. Webcloak‰ã¢ will switch to the SafeWeb browser and automatically log you into the site. You don‰Ûªt need to remember all of your passwords, and all of your important sites, passwords and account numbers are easy to find in the SafeKeeper system.

A Growing Issue
Each year the Internet becomes more dangerous, attacks by hackers become bolder and more sophisticated. The risk of infections by viruses/spyware and the cost to individuals/companies are increasing at an alarming rate. The computer and Internet security industries have simply not been able to keep pace in combating this new generation of attacks. Key industry experts are speaking out about the problem, but lack solutions.
If You Are Browsing, You Are Vulnerable - When browsing the Internet users unknowingly step into a cyber-war zone exposing their data and hardware infrastructures. Open a browser to the Internet and you open a doorway that swings two ways - outward toward the vastness of the Internet and inward toward the guts of your machine. While your browser enables you to go anywhere on the Internet, your browser simultaneously allows cunning wrongdoers to go anywhere inside your computer network.
There are new "Root-kit" viruses that can take over your computer and operate undetected by you, your operating system or your anti-virus software. There are "Botnets" that use the machines of unsuspecting computer users as robots to systematically attack governments and large institutions.
Identity theft, fraudulent transactions, lost productivity and stolen photos are major and growing issues. According to the FTC, identity theft and fraudulent transactions now cost individuals and companies more than $80 billion annually in the U.S. alone. It is estimated that more than 50% of computers are infected by at least one virus, malware or spyware program. With the explosive growth of Internet use comes the exponential growth of Internet attacks. The threat is hyper-real, ubiquitous and costly.
Have you ever clicked a link to realize that you have unleashed a virus on your computer? Do you know anyone who has been the victim of identity theft? We understand your fear.

"My first ‰ÛÏshrink wrap‰Û product came out in the late 80‰Ûªs and was called "Quickstudy for Lotus 1-2-3", which included over 60 highly interactive software simulation based tutorials on a single diskette. You learned how to use software by interacting with a complete simulation of the software. If you had 1-2-3 installed on your computer, Quickstudy would create an interface which allowed you to launch the tutorials from within 1-2-3‰Ûªs menus and dialog boxes. In the early 90‰Ûªs at a Comdex show (a computer tech gathering) the hall was abuzz with talk of the pre-release of a new graphical ‰ÛÏWeb Browser‰Û called Mosaic.

Why you need our product
Today millions of people are tracked through their mobile devices. It‰Ûªs not just when you‰Ûªre using your phone, its 24/7 everywhere you go. The OFF Pocket gives you the option to turn everything OFF.
Project Background
I began working on the OFF Pocket in 2011 because I wanted more control over my privacy. Not just to protect my data, but also to unplug once in a while. I designed the first OFF Pocket as a permanent pocket for my pants.
Creating the first OFF Pocket in 2011, as a pair of pants.
It worked well, and it gave me the freedom to politely disconnect at any moment. But, it was difficult and expensive to reproduce. So I began working on a breakout version of the pocket that anyone could use.
I bought myself a sewing machine and tried to teach myself how to sew, but this proved to be a difficult task. I made about a dozen prototypes with different material combinations. In the beginning the only way to test these prototypes was to call my phone. Gradually, I developed a better understanding of the engineering required to make the pocket, better methods for testing, and at the same time discovered a growing need for the product. 
During the summer of 2012, I met Johanna, a fashion designer and materials consultant living in NYC. I told her about my project and we've been collaborating on it since. It's been a long journey. We have now been working together on the OFF Pocket for almost a full year and have tested countless material combinations and constructions. We‰Ûªve made dozens more prototypes and subjected them to testing both in the studio using diagnostic tools as well as various outdoor locations.
Adam and Johanna at our former Manhattan studio. We're now in Brooklyn!
We released the first version of the OFF Pocket this past January at the Stealth Wear exhibition in London. The response was overwhelming, and our limited production run of the OFF Pocket sold out completely! 
Stealth Wear Exhibition: Tank Magazine Gallery, London
Since January, we‰Ûªve been prototyping and testing new designs, and we‰Ûªve figured out an innovative new construction that balances performance with usability. In developing this project I‰Ûªve tested many other shielding products and have found that the OFF Pocket outperforms them all. The OFF Pocket I've designed with Johanna is not just a phone case, it's a high performance product. It even outperforms law-enforcement grade forensic bags and military specification faraday products. I‰Ûªm proud of the work Johanna and I have put into making this design, and we‰Ûªre also proud that we‰Ûªve done it all here in the USA. 
Making the OFF Pocket
We have researched and tested countless designs and construction techniques to create the most effective shielding device that is easy to use. The exterior uses a high performance material that is unique and has water repellent properties, so it is durable and protective for your phone. The elastic we have chosen is easy to use and provides a secure closure.
One of the first things you will notice about the OFF Pocket is the unique cross design. There are 3 reasons for our cross design: the first to secure your phone in place, the second is to act as a restraint from removing the phone, and the third is visual indication that your phone is OFF. Another detail you will notice when you open the OFF Pocket is the brilliant interior fabric that is comprised of metalized fibers. This is the key behind the function of our product, and it's also one of the main factors that drive the cost of the product. The OFF Pocket is not just a phone case, it's a privacy accessory.

Lab Tests 
To test the OFF Pocket, I developed a method for combining a radio frequency (RF) meter and a phone's internal dBm metering system. To understand how the OFF Pocket works, a basic understanding of electromagnetic waves is helpful. Briefly, phones use radio signals (between 800MHz-2.4GHz) to transmit and receive data. There is a transceiver chip in your phone which sends and receives information to cell towers. The strength of this signal can be read through the phone's software/hardware. 
To determine how effective a shielding device is, the signal strength can be monitored and recorded. For most people, this is represented as bars or dots on the top of your phone. I've carried out the majority of testing on an iPhone because it has 2 antennae, and it is particularly good at scavenging weak signals. I've also tested Samsung phones, as well as BlackBerrys, Nokia, LG, and many others.
In testing the OFF Pocket, I established that it can effectively shield 100dB of signal in the frequency range of 800MHz to 2.4GHz. This number represents a very high shielding capability. For comparison, several law-enforcement forensic bags only offer 80dB of shielding. And the difference is significant: the OFF Pocket is 100x stronger (that's 10,000%)!
Decibels are a logarithmic unit of measurement so a difference of 20dB is a difference of 10^2 (100) times stronger.
RF Meter Testing
Where we are now 
The first OFF Pocket launched in January 2013 at Tank Magazine in London. We had a tremendous response and sold out of our first run. Since then, we've been prototyping, improving the design, and field-testing. The OFF Pocket has now been in use by customers and beta testers for over 6 months. During that time, we‰Ûªve received many responses and comments and have used these to fine-tune the OFF Pocket.
Now, we have a product that's ready to manufacture. We‰Ûªve sourced all of the materials required for production and are in the sample making stage with the factory where we plan to make our first large production run. We‰Ûªre excited to keep all of our manufacturing here in the US and work with as many local vendors as possible. Our studio is based in Brooklyn, and we work closely with businesses in the garment district for producing samples and prototypes. The next step we want to take is to put in our first large production order and start shipping the OFF Pocket to everyone.
Why We Need Your Support
Simply put, we can‰Ûªt make the OFF Pocket without your support! We‰Ûªve come as far as we can on our own and now we need your help. If we can reach our goal, we‰Ûªll be able to create stable production quantities, offset our initial costs of product development and research, and continue to develop this product further.
What Does Our Money Go Towards?
The funding raised from Kickstarter will be used to continue the development and production of the OFF Pocket. If we reach our funding goal, we will be able to cover some of the costs we've assumed so far and have enough to begin production. 
Stretch Goals
Stretch Goal #1: Interactive Sizing Tool
Stretch Goal #2: OFF Pocket Phone Apps (iOS & Android)
Manufacturing Timeline 
We have currently lined up a contract manufacturer here in the USA and have negotiated a delivery schedule. Here are some dates that we have agreed upon for delivery and manufacturing of the OFF Pocket: 
7/31/13 - First top of production sample ready for approval 
8/06/13 - Labels, packaging, and 1st samples ready for approval

So far we‰Ûªve had interest in custom editions and collaborations with artists, and we look forward to hearing any ideas. Our immediate future plans are to commit to making the OFF Pocket an unrivaled product and a great experience. We'd also really like to develop an iPhone & Android app for an enhanced customer experience.

"Who are we to question that and why should we even try?" That's what I used to say.
That all changed, one fateful day, when I met a young girl from North Korea trapped in China. At the tender age of 15, she was sold as a bride into China and was chained down by her ankle whenever the man left the house. After her escape, she lived to share her story and sought help to find her family. This would not be such a difficult task if her family was in the United States. But the problem was that  any attempt to reach out from within China would be blocked by The Great Firewall and the IP address would be traced. If caught they would immediately be deported back to North Korea and it could mean imprisonment or even death.
It was after meeting this girl that privacy took on a new and deeper meaning for me. It was no longer just a constitutional right, but a human right. A matter of life and death. I, then, decided to find a way to help such children, to provide a device which they could use to reach out for help without the fear of being detected on the computer or on the internet.
A Huge Thank You to All Backers!
This is the first step toward a better world, and we look forward to continuing the dialogs and creating more momentum throughout this project and beyond.  You can find us at our website www.jackpair.com.

What is JackPair?
JackPair is an affordable tool that enables average citizens to protect themselves against wiretapping.  It‰Ûªs a pair of encryption devices you put in between your phone and headset, which are connected through standard 3.5mm audio jacks. You can secure your phone line by simply pushing the JackPair button, and your voice will be encrypted. There‰Ûªs no password to remember, no software to install, no service to subscribe to, and it works with any phone through a standard audio jack.
JackPair in the News
From Bruce Schneier:
"JackPair is a clever device encrypts your voice between your headset and the audio jack. The crypto looks competent, and the design looks well-thought-out. I'd use it."
TechCrunch - "The concept is pretty simple: one box plugs into your phone, whether that‰Ûªs a smartphone, landline telephone or VoIP client on a PC, via the standard 3.5mm headphone jack ..."
Ars Technica - "JackPair is part of a wider movement that has struggled against a darker facet of the Internet‰ÛÓthe ease with which it can be monitored."
eWeek - "The hardware approach of cryptography still has a lot of appeal in establishing secure communications."
TechnologyTell - "How it works is simple."
TechFaster - "Whether you‰Ûªre in any of the professions above or you‰Ûªre just concerned about your privacy, JackPair is definitely worth considering."
[Update]
Many viewers have expressed that the current look of JackPair can be improved.  So we have worked with professional design firms and come up with a few new designs proposals here:
You can vote and comment here on Facebook, leave your feedback in the KS comment section, or contact me for your remarks. We'll pick a winning proposal based on your feedback here and use it as the final industrial design for JackPair.

Affordable Tool For Everyone
The existing secure phones on the market today cost anywhere from over six hundred to a few thousand dollars.  It's out of reach for most people, and the worst part is that, you have to give up the phones you're using everyday, and switch to whatever secure phone models dictated by the vendors.  With JackPair, we're enabling every citizen to protect our own privacy by making it under a hundred bucks, and you get to keep using your favorite phones while talking through JackPair's Secure Line.
One-Click Solution
Using JackPair, you can easily protect your privacy by just pushing the JackPair button.  During a phone call, if both sides have JackPair installed, either side can simply push the JackPair button to pair up the two JackPair devices. This triggers JackPair to encrypt your voice conversation using a One-Time-Secret -Key (OTSK) that is created on the fly. The same OTSK is automatically-created and self-destroyed at both ends without leaving the JackPair box.  This means you don‰Ûªt have to remember any password, and no one can break into your conversation without this One-Time-Secret-Key.
No Trace Left Behind
At any time during your phone call, when you push the JackPair button, a new One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK) is generated to encrypt your voice conversation.  This OTSK is created locally in each of the JackPair devices at both ends of the phone call without being exposed over the network(*), and it is destroyed immediately after the phone call is finished, without being stored anywhere outside the JackPair device.  The OTSK is short-lived and self-managed;  it never leaves the JackPair box.  So there is no chance for the OTSK to be compromised by anybody, whether intentionally or accidentally.  This simple security design leaves no trace behind; it not only protects your voice, but also saves us, as the device maker, from the trouble of being harassed by the government or exploited by hackers.
Besides key exchange protocols, the encryption algorithm in JackPair is based on Salsa20 stream cipher, which is selected by eSTREAM, the ENCRYPT Stream Cipher Project organized by the European Union, as part of its final software portfolio since 2008.  Stream Cipher like Salsa20 is a natural fit with OTSK, which is used as the seed for PRNG (Pseudo Randon Number Generator) to create key streams with similar property of One-Time Pad.  JackPair uses open source encryption software and will stay open sourced.
(*): The One-Time-Secret-Key in JackPair is generated using Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange protocol, which is a well-known, fundamental protocol in the security industry since 1976; it allows creation of shared secret without exchanging it over the network (see illustration below).
Direct With No Middleman
JackPair is designed with end-to-end security in mind: there‰Ûªs no relay server or service provider involved in either the voice encryption or the One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK) creation, and the OTSK is never disclosed anywhere, not even to the other party on the phone call.  In order to make sure both sides use the same OTSK for voice encryption and there‰Ûªs no middleman bridging the call, the Pairing Code(*) is designed as a simple way for both parties to authenticate each other through their own voices over the same phone phone.  After your JackPair device has paired up with the other party‰Ûªs (ie, when the LED light turns from red to green), The first thing you should do is to read the Pairing Code on your screen to the other party over the phone, and verify that the Pairing Code is the same on both ends.  The fact that the other party recognizes your voice and acknowledges with the same Pairing Code means these two JackPair devices are directly connecting with each other, with no middleman bridging the call through any other JackPair devices.
(*): Pairing Code is the abbreviated hash digest number of One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK).
Work With Any Phone
JackPair is a standard audio adapter that can be plugged into any phone with a headset and microphone. At any time during a phone call, both parties can plug in the JackPair device to continue their conversation in secure mode over the same call.  JackPair is connected with phones through its 3.5 mm audio jack, which is the universal standard as the audio interface for all kinds of devices, including all tablets, laptops, personal computers, and most mobile phones & Voice-Over-IP devices.  For plain old telephone sets, JackPair also includes a RJ9-to-3.5mm converter for handset-free operation(*). Unlike other security devices on the market that are hard to use and work only with specific phones or carriers, JackPair is compatible with all of your favorite phones today. With JackPair, you don‰Ûªt have to make the trade-off between personal security and life style.
(*): optional accessories included in Full Pack only.
In addition to the 3.5mm audio jack, we also have Bluetooth in our pipeline for the second-generation JackPair. This will make it even easier for you to protect your voice while keep using your favorite phones & gadgets, and it will also prevent Bluetooth headsets from being eavesdropped, since your voice is encrypted by JackPair before it‰Ûªs transmitted through Bluetooth headsets.  Stay tuned for more update on Bluetooth.
Open Source Security
We plan to make it open source for the encryption software in JackPair. This allows our code to be scrutinized by the community and, if there‰Ûªs any security hole, it‰Ûªll be identified & fixed quickly. We understand that security cannot be taken for granted and requires constant vigilance, and open source is a great way for the community to help out and for us to stay alert. 

In addition to open source software, we intend to do open hardware for JackPair as well.  The schematics and gerber-files will be publicly available to make it easier for everyone to review.  The licenses we are considering so far is Creative Commons - Attribution - ShareAlike 3.0.  Let us know if you have better ideas here.


Why JackPair? I Have Nothing to Hide
The right to privacy is not just about ‰ÛÏsecrecy‰Û or ‰ÛÏhaving something to hide‰Û. With modern surveillance technologies, the Government‰Ûªs massive data collection and mining programs are problematic even if people have nothing to hide. The large-scale harvest of small bits of seemingly innocuous data allows weaving of a much more telling big picture of individuals, but it often failed to reflect the whole story.   The problem lies in not only information ‰ÛÏgathering‰Û, but also information ‰ÛÏprocessing‰Û, and here‰Ûªs some examples you should worry about:
Distortion & Misinterpretation: What if the government mistakenly determines that, based on your pattern of activities, you‰Ûªre likely to engage in a criminal act? What if the government thinks your financial transactions look odd‰ÛÓeven if you've done nothing wrong‰ÛÓand freezes your accounts?
Leaking & Secondary Use: What if the government or carrier operator leaks your information to third-parties or the public? What if the government doesn't protect your information with adequate security, and an identity thief obtains it and uses it to defraud you? How long will personal data be stored? And what can it be used for in the future? A lot of times we do not even know about the leakage of our records until long after the damage is done.
Exclusion of Access: Most data gathered by the government is kept secret for national security reasons, and people are barred from accessing and correcting errors in that data. What if the government denies you the right to fly without giving you any reason?
An argument could be that the government does not intend to hurt average citizens. In many cases that is true, but the government can, and has, also harmed people inadvertently, due to errors, carelessness, or policy changes. These massive surveillance programs are no longer about what information people want to hide; they make the individuals powerless and vulnerable in front of the bureaucracy, and create a power imbalance between People and Government. To change the dynamics, JackPair is the affordable tool that enables average citizens to protect themselves against wiretapping and harassment from Big Brother. 
The Story Behind JackPair
JackPair is inspired in large part by Edward Snowden. The first Snowden leak led to the revelation that the NSA collects records of every U.S. phone call under a call log metadata program. It shows that the data collection is no longer about targeted acquisition of information to avert threats. Such a massive scale of surveillance programs has undermined the fundamental American values of freedom and privacy. America is sliding into a state of universal surveillance. This also reminds me of the police state where I grew up, Taiwan. Before the democratic reform, the government could spy on you without reasons and arrest you based on words you have said. Even today, there are still WaterGate-like scandals happening and the politicians get away without any accountability.
With all these breaking news unrolled in front of us, I started to ask myself, what can we do to stop the abusive wiretapping and protect the democracy & freedom we all believe in as Americans? If we can‰Ûªt stop the abuse of power from its root, then what‰Ûªs the next best thing we can do to protect ordinary citizens from being harassed by the abusive power?
As a network security engineer, I've been involved in both sides of the security arm races; on the defense side, I've built computer firewalls and virtual private networks for millions of uses, and on the offensive side, I‰Ûªve designed peer-to-peer protocols and network traversal programs that penetrate those firewalls and VPNs. I know how complex the security technologies can be, and how hard it is for average citizens to make use of the security technologies to defend themselves. Existing solutions available on the market are either too difficult to use, way too expensive, or just not secure at all. So we rolled up our sleeves and built one that‰Ûªs simple, affordable, and compatible with any phone you already have.
This is how JackPair was born.
The Team At Work
AWIT is consists of a small engineering team with high-caliber professionals in the field of distributed networking, embedded systems, peer-to-peer, mobile game, security, and online/web technologies. From the very beginning of this JackPair project, we had the debate of whether it should be a pure software, mobile app solution, or a standalone hardware product.
Evaluation boards for JackPair prototyping
 After surveying the current software solutions on the market, it became clear to us that it‰Ûªs just too easy to break these mobile apps, and both ends of the conversation must use smart phones for it to work. A hardware product built from scratch is the only way to have the security clearance. The current secure phones on the market costs anywhere from over six hundred to a few thousand dollars, which are out of reach for most people. The challenge is how to build a hardware solution that is affordable, easy-to-use, and compatible with most people‰Ûªs existing phones at hand.
Initial Design of JackPair
With the requirements in mind, we set out to find appropriated evaluation boards for our design. I had started off with TI‰Ûªs LaunchPad board, then Dark Shenada, AWIT‰Ûªs guru in embedded system, had taken over and switched to ST Micro‰Ûªs Discovery Boards. We had some initial success there, but it don't meet our requirements for audio channels, and we think we can do better in terms of reducing the component complexity & cost. With help from our friends of professional consultants for schematics and gerber-file PCB layout, we began to put together our own circuit design with minimal components.
JackPair PCB top/side/bottom views
After a few crash and burns, with more helps from team members like Scott and Simon, we are able to pack all the functionality required for JackPair into a small PCB the size of a cigarette lighter. At the same time, Jackie, the Jack of All Trade in AWIT team, has spent time with designer and mechanical engineer to come up with industrial design for the housing of JackPair.

What's Next?
With software & hardware prototypes in place, we have started to talk with our friends and partners in the field of contract manufactures, as well as housing and industrial designs.  AWIT has long-term EMS partners locally right here in Silicon Valley, California, so JackPair will be manufactured and assembled in the United States, although some of the parts like accessory cables might be sourced through non-domestic channels.
We're stretching as far as we can into this project, and the next step is to go into mass production. It costs quite a bit for the tooling & material sourcing in volumes, and we definitely need the Kickstarter community‰Ûªs help now to fund the project and spread the words. So it‰Ûªs time to debut JackPair here at Kickstarter.com.
After a successful Kickstarter campaign, our next step will be to start the custom tooling & PCB manufacturing process, as well as the testing & certifications required for encryption electronics. Here‰Ûªs our road map:
July/August: meet our sponsors at Kickstarter, finalize industrial design and negotiate manufacturing agreements.
September: finalize the mechanical design and place orders for tooling; procurement of electronic parts and materials.
October: pilot productions, tooling build-out, quality verification and certificate qualification.
November: batch manufacturing of PCB, SMT, and housing.
December: assembly and shipment.
  How You Can Help
The cost of tooling, electronic materials, PCB layout, testing and certification approval are quite expensive, and more importantly, in order to make JackPair affordable tool for everyone, we need volume manufacturing with economies of scale to bring down the price of each JackPair device.  Many of our friends have jumped in to help with prototyping of JackPair, and your sponsorship is vital for bringing JackPair to the next step of mass production and making it affordable for ordinary citizens to defend their own right to privacy.  So please pledge your support to make JackPair the tool for everyone.
                     Dragon Innovation has done a 3rd-party review of JackPair and has pre-qualified that we're a team that knows our stuff and that we have a manufacturable product.

GlassKap provides super snappy plastic life hacks for Google Glass that make certain you and your new face-technology avoid bullying from everyone who didn‰Ûªt grow up watching Star Trek: TNG. 
What is GlassKap?  
GlassKap is a plastic, perfectly formed lens cover for Google Glass. GlassKap provides a visual cue to your friends and those around you that you are neither recording them nor snapping pictures with the blink of an eye. The Kaps come in vibrant, noticeable colors that put people at ease. While the Kap is snapped, no recording can happen. 
Yeah, Sure, But What‰Ûªs Google Glass?
 OK Glass! Make my life awesome.
It may be that simple, if you‰Ûªre Sergey Brin. But for the rest of us bold enough to explore the world through Google‰Ûªs new lens, there will be some growing pains to endure. Glass will introduce the world to face-mounted computers that message, check weather, route new locations, suggest the hippest food trucks within walking distance and, yes, take pictures and videos. How is this different from the smartphone collecting lint in your pocket? 
Glass is wearable, hands-free technology that will, like it or not, revolutionize the way we see and use mobile devices. Beta-testing reviewers like me, also known as Glass Explorers, have discussed everything from Glass‰Ûªs cost to the possibility of eye strain; yet the key, recurring issue, identified by myriad tech and Internet resources from Wired to the Chive, remains privacy. Because I‰Ûªm a maker and because I embrace the boundless opportunities and applications Glass brings to the world, I developed GlassKap -- simple devices that will help Glass go from its small steps to potential giant leaps, or at least prevent you from getting slapped in the bathroom. 
The Tumbler? Oh, You Wouldn‰Ûªt Be Interested In That. 
Much like Bruce Wayne‰Ûªs favorite toy, GlassKap comes in black. It also also comes in red, blue, and white.
What‰Ûªs More? 
But why stop there? If anticipating Google Glass has taught us anything, it‰Ûªs that people have bold aspirations when it comes to tricking out their tech. My original goal was to engineer a lens cover, one that would be easy to use and assuage privacy concerns. Once I began, ideas flowed like Klingon Blood Wine. Below are some other devices that will help you get the most out of your fancy tech specs. 
Live, From New York! -- If GlassKap lets you perform your own version of Eyes Wide Shut, the On-Air Sign will open up those eyes like an antihero on Lost. Snap on On-Air and let the world know that you‰Ûªre ready for its close up.

Wearable Planter -- Al Gore endorses this one! Keep your Glass green and let the fresh air breathe around you with your very own Wearable Planter. This device allows you to wear your favorite plant smack dab on your temple. Personally, I‰Ûªm a fan of Colleen Jordan‰Ûªs wearable planters, and I thought it would be great to include them as an accessory. Thanks, Colleen, for your collaboration! 
Pencil Holder -- If you‰Ûªre anything like me, ideas pop up within nanoseconds and often you‰Ûªre left wondering, ‰ÛÏWhere‰Ûªs that darn pencil?‰Û Avoid patting your pockets and searching for a writing tool to no avail with the Pencil Holder. Your pencil is always within a finger‰Ûªs reach, and this handy application also solves the issue of Glass‰Ûª arms taking up valuable lobe real estate. It would probably hold a cigarette too but remember kids; smoking isn't cool, no matter what your parents told you.

Glass Display Shield -- Ah, the great outdoors. Unfortunately Glass does not share your enthusiasm. Glass usually remains vivid and visible outdoors, but on days lauded by the opening lines of the Sesame Street theme, your display will be chased away faster than the clouds. Display Shield helps Glass shine on the sunniest days and also shields your own privacy since anyone can see your Glass screen from the front. This is especially useful when trying to record video from inside your 501st Legion Stormtrooper armor. I found that the light bounces off the inside of the helmet and reflects back into the lens. Ain‰Ûªt nobody got time for that. 

The Two-Way Privacy Shield -- A combination of the Display Shield and the original GlassKap. This device allows the wearer to see their screen in bright environments and block video and photography. The best of both worlds, this time with more Borg. 

The Optigrab -- St. Louis? No, Navin Johnson. We are proud to announce our (fictional) collaboration to bring you a handle attachment for Glass. A great gimmick for Steve Martin fans. And if they make fun of you, just tell them that you‰Ûªre going away and that you don‰Ûªt need any of this, or this. Just this ashtray ... and this paddle game. Maybe a GlassKap. That‰Ûªs really all you need. 

Pew! Pew! -- This handy targeting scope will let you cover Red Three better than Jek Porkins ever did, may he rest in intergalactic peace. Put your friends in your very own photographic crosshairs when they make bad decisions or bust out the sexy mouse costume for Halloween. Also good for, you know, friendly photos. 

The Screen Protector -- How far we‰Ûªve come from flying toasters and desktop-destroying dogs. Worry not about damaging your Glass display. With this product, you can slide a half an inch of protection right on your display and prevent annoying scratches. 

How Are They Made?
GlassKap and all related devices are made of nylon. They are 3D printed using a EOS laser sintering machine. After the parts are printed, they are tumbled, dyed and shipped right to your home or office. 
I Don‰Ûªt Have Glass and I Have No Intention on Shelling Out for One. Why Should I Contribute to This Campaign?
I work and make for the people -- people like you! Inevitably, you are going to encounter someone wearing Google Glass. Help them prevent troll behavior by giving them a GlassKap or one of my other thrilling devices. 
Yeah, yeah ... I got it! But what‰Ûªs in it for me? 
If you back this campaign at the GlassPack reward tier, I will ship you a three-pack of red dyed GlassKaps for you to share with intrepid wearers looking to capture marble busts of Marcus Aurelius like I did last week. With your super pack of GlassKaps, you can ask users to cover up and ‰ÛÏGlass with class.‰Û
Consent is Sexy
I also am offering t-shirts that say ‰ÛÏnot ok, glass‰Û so you can perform your own version of Gandalf‰Ûªs rebuke at the Bridge of Khazad-dum to uncouth Glass users. 
Keep Calm T-Shirt: 
Check out this sweet t-shirt! 
No, the t-shirts are not 3d printed.  They'll be screen printed, high quality American Apparel, made in the USA and sweatshop free.
Thanks Everyone! 
As a designer and engineer, I am immoderately proud of GlassKap and all the devices this creation inspired. I also am grateful for the support and encouragement of everyone who helped turn this project into reality. I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to Annelise Jeske for her excellent videography work and to Nicholas Almanza (@njalmanza) for helping with all of the awesome words on this page. Also thanks to the folks at 23 Ideas for loaning me their Glass device at Noisebridge so I could take initial measurements and hash out some concepts. Noisebrdge, you provided an exceptional workshop for my ideas, and I appreciate it greatly. Thanks also to the Baltimore Node Hackerspace members who gave feedback on the designs, to my friends at Kickstarter, Make, Adafruit, ShapeShot, Autodesk, Shapeways and MakerBot and to everyone else who helped me get to where I am today.
Well, our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still get a myIDkey! Head over to www.myIDkey.com for more information and to place an order.

Unlocked (and protected) with the swipe of a finger, myIDkey is the Industry's first biometric secure Bluetooth / USB drive and password manager.
Why did we create the myIDkey? We recognized a familiar pain point in most digital users lives and built a simple password management device. Today, we have literally hundreds of passwords, account numbers and other important information that we have to remember. myIDkey is the first fingerprint, voice-search, secure Bluetooth / USB drive that displays passwords and ID on the go as well as works with all smart mobile devices and personal computers. Now passwords and account information is at the tip of your finger.
"The (myIDkey) thumb drive stores passwords across various services, letting you take 'em on the run." - Engadget
"I hate to use the term "sexy" to describe a gadget, but if the myIDkey isn't "sexy," at least it's "damn fine." - CNET
"I tried to think of anything I might want to add to this password management powerhouse, and didn't come up with anything." - PC Magazine
"For interacting with mobile devices, myIDkey communicates over Bluetooth, providing password management using their iOS and Android apps." - BYTE (& Information Week)
"If you're worried about accidentally brushing your finger against the drive on your keychain, you can add an optional tap sequence to further protect passwords." - LAPTOP Magazine
"You can plug the device into a computer via USB, or you can connect it to a laptop or a mobile device via Bluetooth - it's a veritable all-around password depot." - Digital Trends
"The device can even generate unique passwords that would be too complicated to remember otherwise for additional protection" - SlashGear
"Should you happen to misplace your myIDkey or have it stolen, it is a snap to deactivate its contents for added peace of mind." - Ubergizmo
Unparalleled protection + Quick and easy access. With myIDkey, your finger (or thumb) print is your key to unlock your highly personal data such as passwords, bank accounts, passports, etc. Simply swipe your thumb or finger across the reader to view passwords and more.
When you need it fast, simply speak. After unlocking your myIDkey with a finger swipe, you can simply press and hold the microphone button and speak into your myIDkey to quickly recall and see that important number, date or whatever personal data is needed in a flash.
Complete password management. Whether wirelessly connected to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth, or when directly plugged into your desktop or notebook PC via USB, myIDkey autofills your credentials for any site. With complete password management that is also protected by your fingerprint, you never have to remember another password again! Plus, myIDkey can automatically generate unique passwords for further protection - all of which is easily managed with the myIDkey app.
Now you have a key to all your devices. By wirelessly syncing your myIDkey to your iPhone, iPad or Android phone or tablet via Bluetooth, you can create an extra layer of security for protecting what matters most. 
Free myIDkey app makes it easy... and safe.  Customize your log in with multiple finger swipes, tap sequences and more to create unbreakable access to all of your most important or sensitive content.
You have stuff you want protected no matter what. We can relate, and with the myIDkey app, you can easily select anything you'd like to have more security on your iPhone, iPad or Android device.
When you need it, there it is. With built-in and customizable OLED display, you can easily see that important data no matter what the lighting is around you. With voice search and included scroll buttons, you can easily find your passwords and important data.
Want even more protection? With optional tap sequence, you can set up a personal sequence that needs to be administered along with your thumbprint to unlock your myIDkey. So set up one tap, two taps or a custom pattern only you would know to further protect your passwords and identity.
Made to fit your busy, mobile lifestyle. myIDkey easily attaches to your key ring, your purse or whatever you choose so it can always be by your side. Think of it as your personal, safe key to all the numbers, codes, dates and passwords you use every day.
Security and style in one. With a removable ONYX BLACK protective case, you can ensure your myIDkey is protected during your busy lifestyle. The case easily slips over the device and locks into place for ultimate protection from scratches, wear and tear.  Bonus for Kickstarter backers:  in addition to the included case, we're throwing in a free PEARL WHITE case.  Plus, we'd like our backers to vote on the next case color!
You can't be too safe when dealing with passwords. We employ the latest security and encryption protocols to ensure your passwords and other personal data is always safe. We never keep your data anywhere in a form that isn't encrypted - so only you (and your fingerprint of course) can access.
Fail-safe protection, even if lost or stolen. If your myIDkey is ever lost or stolen, you're still protected. If there are multiple attempts to access the information within, myIDkey will automatically erase everything so you're still protected. If you retrieve your myIDkey or purchase a new one, you can simply restore your information by syncing to your desktop or to our secure cloud.
Get complete protection AND complete control. Connecting multiple myIDkeys together for sharing secure information is simple. Plus, you can easily set your backup settings to sync with our cloud, another cloud service (ie DropBox or Google Drive) or via encryption to your PC, phone or tablet. So in case your myIDkey is ever lost or stolen you can stay protected. 
The news is catching on quick. We've only just begun talking publicly about myIDkey and the response has been overwhelming. We're getting product requests from all around the world and have already been recognized by the Consumer Electronics Association with 3 innovation awards. 
Let us show our appreciation! All myIDkey campaign backers will get their name listed (optional, of course) on our website.
We need your support.  Please purchase our limited edition Kickstarter t-shirts - every bit of support helps! As we hit various campaign milestones our pledges will also receive additional special perks.

What is WigWag?
WigWag lets you build intelligent environments anywhere with Internet-connected sensors and devices by letting you graphically write rules, "When" [this] happens "Then" do [that].  No complicated programming languages or computers necessary, rules are easily built on smartphones and tablets.  The more WigWag and third party devices in your account, the more you can do!  
(Makers & Developers: Also works with Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. Check out the "Under the Hood" section towards the end of the page.)
Example Rules
Turn on a fan when the humidity rises.
Get notified when kids are messing around with stuff they shouldn‰Ûªt be.
Receive a ‰ÛÏthirsty‰Û tweet from your plant, or even better, turn on the water!
Log the date/time when people enter a room, send it to a spreadsheet in Dropbox.
Place a sensor on your porch, get a text when a package arrives.

Rules can happen anywhere, and can be easily shared with your friends and family:
How WigWag Works...
What are the WigWag devices?
It's just the beginning, so we made three devices so you can get started making your environment listen, react and talk to you...
The Relay connects WigWag and third party devices to our cloud service, which allows your stuff to interact with many Internet services, such as email, Dropbox and Twitter. It also makes your sensors work together, so they and the rules they activate are smarter.
One WigWag Relay can cover a house. Use multiple Relays to cover multiple locations worldwide. If the Internet is down, the Relay enables your devices to continue to work at that location. One Relay is required per account, and is included in all packages.
Free lifetime WigWag Cloud subscription with each Relay purchased in this Kickstarter campaign!
The Sensor Block is a universal sensor device with 8 environmental sensors, 4 control features, and 2 expansion ports.  It can measure light, detect motion, sound, temperature, humidity, movement, contact closure, and you can setup infrared (IR) tripwires between two blocks.   It can control things such as: an electronic relay - (open a garage door or turn on a sprinkler), IR devices (change channels on a tv). It can also blink and play simple sounds for alerts. 
The block also has two expansion ports to add future things such as plant moisture probes, and contact sensors.  The block can be powered with four AA batteries or the included USB power adaptor.
The final design of the Sensor Block will be a bit more refined with rubber corners molded into the case to protect, eliminate vibrations and allow the module to easily stand upright. You can choose from a midnight black Sensor Block (with a Kickstarter green trim), which hides well in dark places, or a soft white Sensor Block good for interiors.
The WigWag Glowline provides dynamic indirect or mood lighting. It can also detect ambient light and motion. It is perfect lighting for stairs, outdoor patios, kitchen cabinets, bathroom sinks and enclosures. It will ship with 2.5m (~8ft) of RGB LED strip lighting (upgradeable to 5m), and a power supply.
The following video shows the basics of the Glowline and how WigWag's App can work with other kinds of lighting!
WigWag can work with a lot of other devices as well. And in many cases, WigWag will auto-detect devices you may already own, such as Phillips Hue‰ã¢ light bulbs and Belkin WeMo‰ã¢ outlets.
These devices can participate in rules and get control just like anything else. The system treats different devices as categorized objects, so ‰ÛÒ for instance ‰ÛÒ you can have light bulbs from different vendors, yet still do control the same way. Even matching color and brightness: 
WigWag can also work with other protocols and automation standards. 
The Relay can take optional modules which plug in to support additional protocols. These options will be available when the campaign successfully funds.
Putting it all together
WigWag connects to multiple third party products in addition to the Sensor Block and WigWag Glowline. It presents all these devices in your account for building rules. The Relay and our cloud service listen for each "When" and "then" executes your rules.
What are the packages?
We put together several packages for tinkers, enthusiasts and people who just want to try out WigWag, without a huge commitment.  In general the "Pick 2" is good to try out each product, and the "Pick 4" and "Pick 10" are to help you outfit a room and house.  There are Early-Bird backer levels throughout as a special thank you to those who help us make our goal!
What package should I get?
It depends on what you want to do.  If you're not ready to commit to a whole house deployment, or just looking to try out WigWag with a minimal commitment, back with the "Sensor Kit" for a single sensor block, or the "Lighting Kit" for a single Glowline.  What to try both and use them together? Get the "Pick 2."  Want to do more?  Such as outfit a room with sensors and indirect lighting?  Look at the "Multi-Room Kit (Pick 4)."  With the "Pick" options you chose the mix of Sensor Blocks and Glowlines at the end of the campaign. All kits include a Relay, which means you can listen to and control a lot of other devices also. Use the following table as inspirational ideas for your own spaces! 
Add-Ons
Thanks to the support of early backers we are able to offer sensor add-ons for kits! Some add-ons work with any kit (since all kits include a WigWag Relay), other add-ons plug into the Sensor Block, requiring at least one Block.
More details are in these updates:
Enclosure Sensor: Update 10
Presence Sensor: Update 6, Update 7, Update 9
Wired Contact Sensor: Update 2
Soil Moisture Sensor: Update 3
4x Relay Extension: Update 5
Refer to Update 2 for instructions on how to adjust a pledge level to receive these add-ons.
Why WigWag? 
The promise of automated environments has existed for decades, but it is still not a reality for most. Why? The biggest reason people don‰Ûªt have ‰ÛÏsmart homes‰Û and intelligent environments is twofold:
It‰Ûªs a major hassle to deploy and program automated systems.
Traditional systems lack the necessary sensory and historical data to become aware.

We are solving these problems in a number of ways‰Û_
Easy Setup
WigWag devices are super easy to setup. Place them where you need them, either permanently or for temporary use. No pairing, no passwords & no SSIDs... Just scan with the WigWag App, and the device appears on your phone.
Easy Customization
Traditionally, customized automation has been limited to permanent installations by professionals or people willing to spend countless hours configuring. WigWag‰Ûªs Rules approach is built for customization. As an example: Rules can be set to run once, repeat after acknowledgement, and run continuously. This way you can make one-time notifications or permanent behavior.
Sensor Fusion for Powerful Information
Sensor networks are really useful when multiple sensors work together to make smarter decisions.  WigWag lets you do exactly that.
A single motion sensor only detects presence temporarily, however, multiple motion sensors can detect direction of movement. Average temperature in a location is much better than a temperature reading from just one sensor, and so forth.
Learn from History
WigWag‰Ûªs platform learns by recording what happens. Historical information lets WigWag differentiate real change from sensor "noise."  For instance, the WigWag platform benefits from knowing if a room is normally light or dark, not just the room's current status.   WigWag is about making intelligent decisions ‰ÛÒ to make automated environments convenient, not annoying.
Who is WigWag?
WigWag is a startup out of Austin, Texas, comprised of engineers, programmers and designers. We have staff in Austin, Texas and Wuxi, China. Some of our team members are University of Texas computer science and electrical engineering students. Founder Ed Hemphill worked at another startup in the pro-AV industry for six years before leaving to start WigWag. Our primary investor and advisor, Jean-Marc Trinon, is also a developer and home automation pro, and has successfully created several other startups.
Everyone at WigWag is a developer and can write code. We are a true bootstrap startup. If you live in or around Austin, and are a backer ‰ÛÒ come by ‰ÛÒ we will be happy to show you some of our stuff.
How far along is WigWag in the production process?
As per Kickstarter guidelines, everything you see is a real physical prototype. We have a working Sensor Block, Glowline and Relay, and our cloud service is running for internal testing. The iPhone app you see in the video/pictures actually runs today, controlling and creating rules, and our Android app is underway. All boards are designed by WigWag and manufactured in Wuxi, China. The cases shown were printed on 3D printers. Our design, development and assembly happens in Austin, TX USA.
 When will I receive my products?
Timeline:
June: Kickstarter launch
August: Kickstarter campaign ends, funded
September: Molds built, FCC and CE compliance testing: Dev Kit boards built
October: Dev kits ship, production boards & molds built
November: final assembly and shipment
Circuit boards and plastics will be manufactured in China, and final assembly / testing / shipping of products will take place in Austin, TX. All rewards should be shipped to backers by November 2013.
How will WigWag use the Kickstarter funds?
The funds raised here will allow us to:
Make things cooler: Create more refined case designs for the Sensor Block, Glowline and Relay. What you see above are printed prototypes.
Make things smaller: Do final board spins aimed at shrinking the size of a few components.
Make things legal: Complete FCC / ECC testing (for non-dev kit products)
Allows us to create tooling for plastic parts
Continue development of the cloud platform, DeviceJS, and the phone app and web front-ends.
The more funding we get, the quicker we can build more functionality into WigWag Cloud, Relay and DeviceJS.

Warning - Geek Area (i.e. for developers & makers)
Modern Development Environment
Graphical programming + Javascript Core
One of the coolest things about WigWag is the way it works. Anyone can build Intelligent systems graphically through the WebUI or App. But, if you know Javascript and want to go deeper ... Read on.
Unlike proprietary automation systems, anyone with basic programming skills can go deep with WigWag. The rules built with our app or web interface actually generate Javascript for you. You can start by just looking at rules created with the graphical tools, and then modify those to do more. Most of the platform is extensible via Javascript, which means you can make WigWag talk to almost anything.  To do this we built DeviceJS.
DeviceJS: Open for Developers, Designers and Tinkerers
DeviceJS is an open-source runtime for executing Javascript.  It is built on Google V8 and Node.js.  Anyone who knows anything about programming should be able to start hacking things in the physical world easily.  WigWag uses the same language and many of the same programming patterns that drive millions of web pages today.
DeviceJS ties Javascript to the physical world, by providing hooks for protocols like IP, 6loWPAN, Bluetooth‰ã¢, Zigbee‰ã¢, RS-232, and devices such as the Belkin WeMo‰ã¢ and Phillips Hue‰ã¢ light bulbs.  Because the system is centered on Javascript, it is very easy for anyone to extend.
WigWag Cloud pushes Javascript to your Relay (or a Raspberry Pi using the Dev Kit's board), which executes distributed Javascript.  Because of this architecture, the same code can execute across multiple locations, whether those are floors in the same house, or buildings in different countries. Moreover, even when the Internet is down, rules still execute on the Relay thanks to DeviceJS's caching.  
Perfect for Makers
WigWag is a powerful tool for Makers. You can breath life into your hardware project with wireless connectivity to the Internet, a smartphone application, local automation systems, cloud services, and a whole lot more. The dev kit will come with three boards which provide connectivity to DeviceJS + WigWag Cloud: a WigWag Experiment board, a Raspberry Pi shield and an Arduino shield.  You worry about the fun part - building the device - we worry about connecting it to the world.

Your hardware projects can now work with rules:  You spec your Triggers (aka ‰ÛÏWhens") and Actions (aka ‰ÛÏThens") on the WigWag Cloud with DeviceJS. The Arduino shield will provide Arduino makers complete wireless (6loWPAN) connectivity to your Relay, and we will provide a module so that you can write sketches that connect to DeviceJS / WigWag Cloud.
The development kit comes with three development boards to let you experiment, prototype and build WigWag-connected devices. It will also include a Relay and Sensor Block.
Devices created with development kit will get the same first-class capabilities as the above Sensor Block and Glowline. You can scan + add the device, control it from the WigWag App, and build rules with it. The kit will include three unique QR / NFC tags for each of the development boards. 
Support for Raspberry Pi
DeviceJS isn‰Ûªt just for the WigWag Relay:
Included in the Dev Kit is a shield for the Raspberry Pi, which lets the Pi take the place of a Relay.  With the shield, the Pi talks to the WigWag Cloud,  the Sensor Block, Glowline and WigWag-enabled Arduino devices. This option is great for developers and hackers who want to experiment with DeviceJS and 6loWPAN hardware. It can also make your Raspberry Pi function as an end WigWag device as well, with "When" and "Then" capabilities of it's own.
We will provide a Raspbian package for DeviceJS + WigWag Cloud Connect, as well as source tarballs. Install it, and you will have connectivity from your smartphone to your 6loWPAN hardware from anywhere.
Utilizes Open Hardware and Open Software
Much of the WigWag system is open software and hardware.   DeviceJS, and the firmware that runs on WigWag's development hardware devices is open software. WigWag hardware devices (Sensor Block, Glowline, the Arduino shield) are based on Contiki -- a tiny OS targeted at 6loWPAN devices. Around the ship date software for the Arduino and Raspberry PI development boards will be available on Github, and hardware designs for the Development kits will be provided.
 It's finally time to say goodbye to tangled wires and bulky headphones. The Truebuds team has developed a breakthrough wireless in-å_ear headphone that fits comfortably in your ears and lasts 6 hours on a single charge, which is currently the longest battery life in the market. Use the portable charging case and get another full charge in only 45 minutes. 
In early market testing, the two main pain points of current wireless earphones on the market were size and battery life. We took that to heart and optimized Truebuds to both be the smallest in the market and to have the longest battery life, in order to make the best completely cordless earbud out there.
The small size doesn't mean you should expect little in terms of sound quality. Here's what makes Truebuds sound great:
Use of balanced armature audio transducers which offer very low noise distortion, and which are optimally tuned to specific frequency ranges.
Use of the AptX codec ensures that the sound you hear over Bluetooth is CD-like quality. AptX uses special bit rate reduction techniques to offer Bluetooth sound that is indistinguishable from corded headphones.
A proprietary-designed module creates ultra-low latency between both Bluetooth earbuds, so you hear exactly the same thing in both ears with no difference whatsoever.
An ambient noise cancelation module is included to make sure that when your Truebuds are in your ear, the music is all you can hear.
Truebuds were designed with fashion and comfort in mind. They are the smallest Bluetooth earbud, which makes them fit inside your ear without any extra bulkiness. The metallic finish gives them a cool, futuristic look, so people will be asking you where you got those cool earbuds.
Connect in seconds using Bluetooth
Connecting Truebuds is just a matter of a few clicks. Truebuds connects with any device that has Bluetooth, including iPhones, Android phones, and most mp3 players. It works the same way any Bluetooth-enabled audio device does, so it's simple and ready to go out of the box.
Technical Specs
Below is a full proposed technical specification of our product. Note that these are subject to change by new input and guidelines received from both the backer community and the product design team. We will be updating the community as we continue to scale up manufacturing for the product, and will be conducting polls throughout the process to make sure we are giving the backer community exactly what you want.
Truebuds are fully prototyped, and we need your help to scale up manufacturing so we can bring them to market
A full working prototype has been created. We are also experimenting with various fits, materials and more to give you the best quality when we deliver the product.
We come from technical product design and engineering backgrounds and have been creating electronic devices for over a decade. We're also working with experts who have manufactured headphones for the biggest consumer brands out there, so we know how to bring these types of devices to market.
Here is a snapshot of the Truebuds team working to make this project a reality.
We need your help to make Truebuds a reality for everyone who needs a small wireless earbud with long battery life and great design. By supporting us, you will be part of our journey from the current version to full production. Your voice will be heard, and we will implement changes, stretch goals and more with your help.
Your contribution will be used to:
Finalize product design
Fund mechanical tooling of the product 
Compliance testing ‰ÛÒ FCC, UL, CE.
Order components
Pay for production, manufacturing & shipping costs of the first production run of Truebuds.
We appreciate every action you take to make Truebuds a reality. Help us out by sharing our project with social media or email. We greatly appreciate any of your involvement. Thank you.

This Kickstarter is over, but you can still pre-order Point on our website.
We found existing home security solutions too invasive. We wanted to know that everything was fine at home, but without having a camera in the living room. That's why we designed Point.
Meet Point.
The home has always been a focal point of Scandinavian culture. Despite its importance, when we're away we can feel disconnected. We want to know everything is fine at home, but our only options have been cameras and invasive sensors.
We wanted a softer, more balanced take on security. We created Point to make a stand: peace of mind without compromising the feeling of home.
Point is subtle and small‰ÛÓthe size of the palm of your hand. It's designed to blend in to any home, anywhere. These are results of a focus on simplicity beyond aesthetics.
Current security systems are complex, often requiring daily interaction. Point requires no attention except an annual change of batteries. It's designed to erase worries, not create them.
Point keeps things simple for you, but does plenty while you're away. It listens to the sounds of your home, senses the indoor environment, and analyses the air. Point translates all data into information you care about. It notifies you of windows breaking, alarms ringing, or the presence of smoke.
You can tell Point how to respond to events: for instance, it can glow yellow if it detects cigarette smoke, or sound an alarm in case of windows breaking.
Point connects to the Internet through WiFi so you can stay in touch wherever you are.
Who is Point for?
Chances are Point is for you. Home is a place where we feel safe and comfortable. It's a private place that we share with family, friends and guests. Whether you're home alone or not, it's a place where you can relax and let your guard down. It's no place for surveillance cameras.
Homes come as different as the people they belong to, so we designed Point to be adaptable to your situation. Here are some ways it fits into people's lives.
Zoe rents an apartment downtown. She enjoys travelling, and sometimes spends the weekend with her parents. She doesn't need a full security system but Point gives her comfort to know that all is fine when she is away.
Anna is an Airbnb host. With Point she can host guests new to her home with confidence. She is notified in case of accidents and if the sounds levels are too high late at night, Point will glow yellow as a friendly reminder for her guests to keep it down.
Dave lives in an old building with his family in Scotland. His home has some quirks, but Point keeps Dave on top of things. It lets him keep an eye on humidity and air quality levels, helping to reduce the risk of mold.
What does Point do?
Point combines a wide array of sensor data with the sounds of your home and turns it into information you care about. Point can let you know about guests arriving, windows breaking, presence of smoke or alarms going off‰ÛÓthe things you worry about when leaving your home.
You primarily communicate with Point through your smartphone, but it also comes with a speaker and lights to give immediate feedback to people in your home.
You could set Point to light up if there is a loud noise in the middle of the night or to glow yellow in the presence of cigarette smoke. Every home is unique, so we made it easy for you to set up Point to be like you want it to.
Sound & Presence. Point listens, analyzes what it hears and tells you about the things you care about. Since all analysis is done on the device, no sound is recorded or sent across the network.
Friendly Reminders. You can set Point to glow yellow when the volume goes above thresholds you set, reminding guests to be considerate with neighbors in the early hours. 
Air. Point‰Ûªs innovative sensor technology allows it to recognize things like smoke, cigarette fumes and other common home hazards.
Temperature. Ever wondered what your Nest thermostat is really up to when you're away? Point has your back and comes equipped with a temperature sensor.
Humidity: Point can sense elevated humidity levels in the air. This could indicate a major water leak from broken pipes, blocked ventilation systems or a jungle taking over your bedroom (it happened to this guy Max our mothers told us about). Keeping an eye on humidity can help you prevent problems with mold and moisture.
Tampering: Point notices if it's taken down and put in a cupboard.
Wireless: Point comes with a state-of-the-art WiFi chipset, letting it operate without a base station. You can place it anywhere in your house where your smartphone has WiFi coverage.
Very Wireless: Point does all its magic using regular, replaceable batteries. It should last for more than a year under normal conditions with the included batteries.
Installation: Point takes an instant to install. You place a metal plate with double-sided tape (or a screw if you prefer) to your ceiling or wall. Point then attaches with magnets. No more fumbling on stairs, just toss Point towards the ceiling and it'll probably stick (don't actually do this).
Partners.
Connect Point to the apps and products you use every day with IFTTT. IFTTT lets you create powerful connections with a simple statement ‰ÛÓ if this then that. It‰Ûªs like duct tape for the Internet. You could for example make your Philips Hue lights glow blue or red depending on the temperature. The only limit is your imagination (and judgment‰ÛÓbut don't let us stop you).
Point and Lockitron can talk to each other (and they get along too). You can use Lockitron to unlock your door for guests without keys. Connect it to your Point and all events will show up in one place, making it easy to get an overview of your home.

Rewards.

Comes with a free API for developers will be made available to utilize all the PebbleBee functions and Sensor data for whatever you want!
Recent Update - Testing Water Resistance:
We've recently received the latest sample that is completely ultrasonically sealed. Keep in mind the app is still in development. Volume is subjective to the recording environment, so we setup an audio monitor to give you the actual loudness not subject to interpretation. But forget enough about that! Have you seen a bluetooth tag work under water before? LOL pretty awesome! granted it's not that much water, but signals usually don't work that far into water.  
Latest iOS Update 3/22/14
We have already made considerable progress and continue development as we near completion of the iPhone app.
PLAY

Latest Android Update 3/22/14  
Still in it's initial phase, but we are continuing to make great progress and should have a major update next week with much more functionality.
PLAY

*Note: The PebbleBee Honey does not include the 9-axis motion and temperature sensor, but includes all other functionality. The PebbleBee Hornet includes the 9-axis motion and temperature sensor.  The Dragon has same sensors as the Hornet but also includes wireless charging.
PebbleBee Evolution (from left to right)
Development
The PebbleBee idea first emerged late 2012 as a solution to a curious toddler's obsession with hiding things.  After the little man battles his way to bed, Nick wants nothing more but to relax and watch a movie before bed.   But alas, there is no remote!   Nick thought to himself; how is it still so hard to find your remote?   Why don‰Ûªt TV‰Ûªs have a "find" function much like cordless phones have implemented for decades?  
The next day Nick and Daniel met to discuss a potential solution.  The design started from simple, affordable but effective RF devices that would communicate to a Bluetooth hub.  The PebbleBee worked for home applications but we thought bigger.  Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy was hitting more and more devices and we found that it really could meet our power and range constraints for a portable device.  Daniel and Nick put together hardware and software specifications, 3D designs and print circuit board layouts.   
Our goal from day one has been producing a quality product that exceeds your needs at a very affordable price.   We communicated with multiple vendors regarding affordability without any compromise to quality, and found one that fit the bill.  The PebbleBee kept on evolving as Daniel and Nick found more everyday uses such as incorporating a 9-axis gyroscope for motion tracking and a thermometer.   In August 2013 it was clear the manufacturer we first picked didn't share our vision for quality and growth.  Another manufacturer trade study was conducted and the perfect fit was found. They share our enthusiasm for the PebbleBee vision and future capabilities.  
The only thing that stands in our way now is funding this endeavor to make it available to you at such an affordable price.  Please help us make the PebbleBee become a reality so we can build an amazing product together.

XY is the stylish, affordable, and secure iBeacon compatible Tag for iPhone and Android that makes finding things easy.
10 minutes a day.
The average person spends 10 minutes a day trying to find lost things. That means that on average, you spend over 4 hours a month, 2 days each year, and 6 months of your life trying to find things you own. With XY, you can keep of track everything important to you, and take back that time.
What is XY?
XY is a Bluetooth LE powered tracking tag that you can put on anything important to you. The tag syncs with your smartphone to help you keep track of all the things that matter to you. You can attach as many XY tags to your phone as you like, and can easily find your nearby tags.
XY is perfect for putting on your keys, purse, tablet, and luggage. The small stylish design lets you keep track of all your things, and the secure server ensures that you control who is able to see your items. 
XY is also the best way to keep track of your pets. You can easily attach an XY tag to your pet's collar, and know if they leave the house and feel secure in knowing that if they wander off, XY will let you know.  
How it Works
The XY app listens to nearby Bluetooth LE signals.  When the app finds a new tag, it checks our servers see what information about the tag is available to you.  If you are not permitted to see the tag, it will not show up on your list.  
1) Find-It: By activating Find-It mode, you can track any tag that is within range of your phone.  The on-screen indicator will show you as you get closer to the tag, and will help you find your misplaced item. If the item is not within range, the app will show you where it was seen last.
2) Keep-It:  For anything you want to ensure is always by your side, you can activate Keep-It mode, and your phone will alert you if you move out of range of the tag.  In Keep-It mode, you will never leave something important behind again.
3) Lost-It:  You can mark any tag as lost right from the app. Once it has been set as lost, XY will alert other users if they come across the item, or can just tell you where the item was just seen.  
Affordable enough for your keys. Secure enough for everything that matters
The two most important things we have been working on during the development of XY are Security and Affordability.  We believe that it is of the utmost importance that any item you use to keep track of your things is secure.  To keep your items safe, we utilize a rotating cipher to keep the information about your tag secure.  The only people who will be able see your tags are the ones that you have given permission.  
We also believe that it is very important to keep the price of each unit as low as possible, so you can afford to keep track of all the things that matter. We have been talking to many different manufacturers, and can effectively keep the price of the units down by purchasing a large volume of components. This inventory requirement is the single biggest reason we need your help.  
Compatibility
XY uses Bluetooth LE technology, and is compatible with iOS7 devices, as well as Android devices that are equipped with Android version 4.3 and above.  
Colors
When we ship, XY will be available in the following colors:
Development Timeline
We have been hard at work on this for the last 18 months, and we are nearing completion.  
Proof of Concept: We started this project by setting up 2 phones to send/receive Bluetooth signals. From this, we were able to show that we could set a device to alert when another was out of range.
Initial Prototypes: We bought every different Bluetooth LE chip we could find. We compared battery life, signal strength, signal consistency, and more. In the end, we determined that the CC2541SOC chip had the best performance.
Product Design: We started off knowing that we wanted to design a distinctive, stylish shape for our product. We started drawing and carving shapes from wood to test our different styles. Pretty quickly, we decided that we needed to get a 3D printer to start rapid prototyping. After testing different widths, diameters, and faceted shapes before we finally settled on the final XY tag design. 
App Development:  While all this was going on, Daniel was hard at work on our iPhone App. Today, we have the app nearly completed.  We have made it easy to sync a new tag to your phone. 
To find a tag that is in range of your phone:

To see when a tag has gone out of range:

And to track where and when a tag was last seen:

We are working on the finishing touches of the iPhone App, and will be completing the Android App shortly after that.  With the help of Kickstarter, we will be able to manufacture and ship our first tags by June of this year.  Our manufacturing timeline looks like this:

 Rewards
The Team 
While we have a dedicated team of developers, designers, and engineers at XY, the team is led by these two members:
Daniel Wang (President):
Daniel began his long career in technology at the tender age of 12 developing ‰ÛÏturbo‰Û loaders for the Commodore 64 (basically it just turned off the display so the 1mhz MOS 6510 could actually do some work).  After getting his CS degree from UCSD, he worked on various projects for Viewpoint (3D rendering), Disney (software for kids) and was the CTO of Xdrive, a cloud storage pioneer acquired by AOL.  In the early 2000‰Ûªs, he joined a few friends to develop an industry-leading fraud detection system based entirely on numerical analysis of large amounts of financial data ‰ÛÓ a system that is still used today by top accounting firms and hedge funds.  Turning his interests to mobile in 2012, he developed two highly-rated collaborative consumption apps Nifty & Nifty Deals, both available in the AppStore.
Nicholas Trouw (Lead Product Designer):
An Ohio native, Nick Trouw got his career off the ground beginning in college, where he founded, owned and managed several arts and performance organizations and business ventures. As one of his first, Urban Renaissance Outreach Group worked to increase English fluency scores in underfunded schools across the country. After two years of traveling the U.S. for arts and education, Nick united this experience with his interest in software engineering and became president of a start-up business that worked to create free, online educational resources for teachers and students nationwide. Shortly after, he began contracting for different corporations as a software developer, which led him to do the same at Webble, an indoor event navigation and mapping solution technology. Now, as the lead product designer and software developer for XY, Nick engaged his creativity and arts background to perfect the XY prototype and currently heads the team of developers and engineers to manufacture the tag and app for consumer use.
 So, please help us make the world better with XY.
iGuardian is the world‰Ûªs first Internet protection system designed specifically for home use.
WHAT THE PRESS SAYS ABOUT iGUARDIAN
Stretch Goals: $166k Stretch Goal Reached!
$166k Stretch Goal Reached!
 THE STORY
Almost every day you can read headlines about cyber-attacks or online threats. Cybercriminals are constantly improving their attack methods to become more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Everyone knows to be careful when clicking on links in emails or opening files. Unfortunately, that is no longer enough. Today, even visiting seemingly safe websites can infect your computer.
For the most part, businesses have figured out how to protect themselves from these new and evolving types of threats. They deploy specialized and expensive firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. But average families and consumers have neither the resources nor the expertise to set up similar network protection for their home Internet or their smart home devices. 
At the same time, consumers today more than ever need an affordable and comprehensive Internet security system designed to stop the advanced threats attacking their networks and the growing number of connected devices they have in their homes,
To protect their home network and connected devices, consumers today have two choices: use antivirus or rely on their router. Antivirus only catches threats once they already are on a device. It is also often ineffective against modern malware. Wireless routers rely on outdated protection and are built to be cheap ‰ÛÒ not secure. In addition, smart home devices connected to the network, like TV/Cable boxes, network storage, VoIP adapters, video game systems, streaming media consoles, thermostats, smoke detectors, security cameras, lights, refrigerators etc. open up even more opportunities for cybercriminals to breach your home network. 
Why are we doing this?
At Itus Networks, we believe all families deserve peace of mind that the devices connected to their home network are secure and protected 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. We bring families best-in-class threat prevention for their home Internet connection at affordable prices. Our network security systems are specially designed to block cyber attacks while filtering out malware and other undesirable content. Installation requires 5-Minutes and zero configuration or technical knowledge. The iGuardian is designed for home Internet users who want peace of mind when using the Internet, but don‰Ûªt want to deal with complex configuration, technical details or costly business-solutions.
This is why we created the iGuardian!
It protects all your computers and connected devices from cyber attacks.
We started Itus Networks in April 2014 to provide effective security for the home and to close the gap between ineffective consumer grade devices and expensive business class protection. iGuardian is the first line of defense for anything trying to get in or out of your home network. iGuardian updates itself regularly, to ensure comprehensive protection without any user intervention.
The Product
The iGuardian is a small device that doesn't need much space - it's all in one very smart little box!

Current Design for Kickstarter Edition iGuardian

Quite Simple
iGuardian is designed to provide business-grade security for home Internet users.
Our typical customer is everyone with a high-speed Internet connection. We give you peace of mind that your Internet connection is safe and secure. 
iGuardian provides true business-class protection, but costs a fraction of the price and requires no technical knowledge to operate. Itus customers also receive lifetime access to free community security updates, so no costly monthly subscription is required to stay protected.
iGuardian offers comprehensive security because it sits at the "source" and is plugged in right where the Internet enters your home. 
We designed the iGuardian this way, so it protects all devices that connect to your home network including smartphones, laptops, desktops, tablets TVs, cable boxes, security camera systems, smoke detectors, thermostats, refrigerators etc.
What is the iGuardian?
The iGuardian is an embedded Linux system based on OpenWRT and runs Snort as an in-line intrusion prevention system. It has been designed and optimized for easy installation and provides advanced threat prevention against a wide variety of attacks. The iGuardian protects your connected devices from Internet threats with a reliable, simple and affordable solution.
The iGuardian protects you against a wide range of threats, including viruses, phishing scams, malicious websites, java, browser, and file exploits, drive-by-downloads, watering-hole attacks, botnets, data-theft, remote access Trojans and key-loggers.
How does iGuardian work?
The iGuardian inspects all traffic coming in and going out of your home network looking for patterns of known attacks. As traffic enters the network it is first intercepted and processed by the iGuardian before being forwarded to its final destination. The iGuardian utilizes Snort as an in-line intrusion prevention system to intercept, decode, normalized, then process packets flowing through the network. The packet data (or payload) is compared against a list of known attack patterns (or rules), if a match is found, the offending packets are dropped and the connection is reset thus preventing the attack from ever reaching it's intended target. By default, the iGuardian utilizes rules in 'Reject' mode.
About Us
Itus Networks is a startup in San Jose, California, founded by veterans of the enterprise network security industry. We believe in something very simple: everyone should know that their home network and everything connected to it are always protected and safe. 
We founded Itus Networks to offer highly effective Internet protection for everyone that is:
                - Comprehensive
                - Easy to use
                - Affordable 

Who is making this happen?
Daniel Ayoub - Co-Founder of Itus Networks. 
Creative Visionary and Inventor of the iGuardian. Daniel is a lifelong hobbyist and hacker turned entrepreneur. When not working on keeping the Internet safer for everyone's home, he enjoys spending time with his wife, two young boys and dog in sunny San Jose.
Jock Breitwieser - Co-Founder of Itus Networks. 
Marketing and communications professional, with 20 years experience in the high-tech industry. Born in Germany, but Californian at heart. In his (rare) free time he loves to hang out with his family and friends and do the occasional triathlon.
A special thanks goes to our strategic partner Rhino Labs, who we work with every step along the way, from development to production to fulfillment. 
Use of Funds
With the funds from our Kickstarter campaign, we'll be able to start production of iGuardian. To reduce the average production cost per unit and be able to offer iGuardian at a consumer price, we need to produce a minimum of 800 pieces. ‰ÛÄ 
Meet Sense by Silk Labs
"Real experiences are missing from the connected products we have now. Silk will make these devices more responsive, more human." - CEO Andreas Gal

TechCrunch / CNET / Fast Company / The Verge / Engadget / Forbes / IoT Podcast

About the Silk Connected Device Platform
Sense is the first product running Silk, a powerful new platform for connected devices that utilizes local processing and deep learning to bring a new age of responsiveness to the connected devices all around us.
Powered by Silk, Sense can detect your presence, recognize your voice and gestures, learn your preferences, and choreograph your connected devices to respond to you appropriately. Sense can act as the eyes, ears, and brain of your connected home! 
What makes Sense different from other "smart" products?
Local vs Cloud Computing: Why does it matter?
Today‰Ûªs "smart" connected devices really aren‰Ûªt smart at all. In fact, most of what we call ‰ÛÏsmart‰Û or "connected" products are really just sensors that you remotely control with your Smartphone through the cloud. Adding connectivity doesn't make them intelligent, and because your personal data is being processed remotely in the cloud, it's not very secure.
Sense runs applications locally on the device itself, and utilizes machine learning to create more intelligent, meaningful, and useful experiences with all of your connected devices.
Seriously serious privacy
Sense and future Silk products will always have privacy measures built into the core of the architecture. We take privacy even more seriously than "seriously." While others may promise you a secure cloud with bank-level encryption and ethical employees, we make it impossible for anyone not in possession of your smartphone, or Sense, to view your private moments.
One-touch setup leverages proximity and Bluetooth LE to securely exchange secret keys between Sense and your Smartphone to enable end-to-end encryption. No one -- not us, not a hacker, not the NSA -- no one but you can access your family's private moments. 
Designed with your life in mind
We've seen connected devices. They're black, white, or grey plastic. They're cold, unforgiving, and just not very appealing.
Early look at Sense
Given the experience we are building, we needed something that was unlike anything seen before. We wanted a unique design aesthetic, something that could live among our favorite things, something made of meaningful materials. Something beautiful!
Materials study
We brought in designer Elliott Koehler on the product design for Sense and we couldn't be more pleased with his warm and thoughtful design.
Camera housing study
The gentle sloping design of Sense is a reflection of the founders' belief that human experiences, beautiful materials, and elegant design soften technology, welcoming it into your life more organically.
Camera field of view and articulation
Elliott designed a product worthy of the Silk Labs name. We can't wait to see Sense living among us in your homes, making technology work the way we know it can!
Final materials
Working prototype
Sense is indeed a beautiful design, but we haven't finished building it just yet! Our cosmetic sample is the final design but right now Sense is a mobile Smartphone board running our Silk software, which you can see below. Using facial recognition, the system recognizes two different people and instantly switches the LIFX lights and plays different music via Sonos.
PLAY

NEW DEMO! One touch set-up
Silk Labs team members Andrea and Philipp demonstrate how simple it is to pair your smartphone to the Sense device. Through a one touch process, the Sense device can securely connect with your smartphone.
Silk is developer friendly 
Silk was designed from the ground up to be extensible for developers like you. Developers have made millions of innovative apps that make smartphones more useful; with Silk you will have the tools to create apps that run locally on Sense to make your home much more intelligent and personal.
Silk is built by the same team that created Firefox OS, so we know how to build great platforms for developers. We understand the importance of simple tools and APIs that give power to developers without compromising user privacy. We know how to foster an ecosystem of developers, and we are excited to do this again with Silk (and Sense) for the home.
If you know JavaScript then you already know how to write Silk apps. That's because Silk is built on Node.js, and yes, your favorite JavaScript tools and npm modules will work just fine. We took great care to abstract out the complexities of computer vision, advanced hearing, and deep learning, so you can get going very quickly with simple yet powerful APIs. Watch as Philipp demonstrates how easy it is to get started.

TarDisk is a secure, tool-free upgrade that doubles (or even triples) the onboard storage of your Macbook by adding up to 256GB of extra space. Simply insert TarDisk into your MacBook's SD slot and TarDisk instantly mounts into OSX as an available drive, semi-permanent and seamless.
Background
After a stressful visit to an Apple Genius Bar with a completely full hard drive in my MacBook Air, I simply needed a way to store more files. As someone who uses my MacBook everyday, this solution needed to work without requiring me lug around extra bulk or delete my existing files and programs. The only options available were time consuming, expensive or would void my Macbook's warranty. I could not accept the "official answer", that there were no easy ways to upgrade the hard drive in a MacBook.
Performance Specs
TarDisk 256, is faster than a traditional USB Hard Drive. It utilizes your computer's SD port, and leverages your high-bandwidth PCIe bus connection to directly transfer data to your system when needed. Speeds are fast:
     ‰Û¢  95 MB/sec Sequential Read.     
     ‰Û¢  70 MB/sec Sequential Write.
Comparisons of USB External 7200RPM Hard-Disk Drives at: http://www.cnet.com 
Technical Details
TarDisk 256 is built around an industry leading flash memory controller. The controller was developed for professional HD equipment requiring UHS Speed Class 3 or above. This provides the core makeup of TarDisk's speed and stability. The controller is paired with high-density 16 GigaByte (128 Gigabit) (MLC) NAND dies. Eight, 16GB NAND chips are assembled into a stack. Two stacks are placed side by side and combine with the controller to produce a final product that is 14mm long x 22mm wide.  
(Stock example image from Kingston Memory)
Design
Secure. Simple. Seamless. Just like the MacBook Pro, TarDisk is constructed from a solid aluminum uni-body frame. A block of 6061 Aluminum is precision machined, to within 0.005 inch accuracy. The metal then undergoes a glass bead blasting and anodization process to add wear-resistance and perfectly to match both your MacBook's texture and color. 
This isn't just about looks though. TarDisk's design provides both physical protection and a performance boost. The unique unibody chassis dissipates excess heat generated by the flash chip, providing for increased longevity and stability.
Seamless Fit
For us, it is crucial that each TarDisk perfectly integrates into the computer for which it has been designed. Feel confident knowing we support all MacBooks with an SD port through six unique designs. There is no ambiguity when shipping the right TarDisk to you -- we have developed a simple "one-click" piece of software, available for download in the Mac App Store, that every backer will use to ensure your TarDisk fits perfectly, before your reward is shipped! 
The Manufacturing Plan
By partnering with a leading flash memory manufacturer to build a miniaturized 256GB MMC chip and a U.S. based, industrial grade, precision metal parts manufacturer; we are proud to introduce the TarDisk 256 Unibody.
The money we raise on KickStarter will pay for tooling and machine time, fund the materials needed for the initial manufacturing batch and incentivize the chip manufacturer to work with us. By supporting our Kickstarter, you are giving us a fighting chance to work with huge manufacturers who otherwise would overlook us. 
Uni-body cases. We will launch a multi-thousand piece manufacturing run at a partnered facility here in Mass. Capabilities & production scale quality have been confirmed and terms have already been negotiated. 
256GB 14mm Chips. We will engage a production run of "short" 256gb chips with a partner facility in Taiwan. Capabilities & production scale quality have been confirmed. 
All finish work, packaging and shipping logistics will happen here in the United States. Assembly is straight forward.
Added Protection
Simply put: TarDisk provides an easy way to double (or triple) onboard Storage in a MacBook. Our Uni-Body-Aluminum, Chip-on-Board design, makes it water proof, shock proof and generally idiot proof. Removal, if ever necessary is easy - just use a finger to slide the drive out. You can easily corral your storage space hogs, like your large iPhoto library, iTunes collection or DropBox account in a snap.  Most importantly, TarDisk maintains the ability to integrate with your MacBook's native TimeMachine. Feel confident knowing that your files are protected in the event of an accident.

 Time Line
Next Steps
With fully functional prototypes in-hand, and a heavy investment in design and sourcing relationships, we have taken the TarDisk as far as we can on our own. We have invested everything into building TarDisk. Now we turn to you, to help us successfully fund the first ever flush, solid-aluminum 256GB MacBook onboard expansion. 
We‰Ûªre humbled that you‰Ûªve taken the time to learn about our project and we sincerely can‰Ûªt thank you enough for the support. None of this would be possible without you! Thank you!

The LoopWallet app will be available for free download. 
The People Behind Loop:
Our founders, Will and George, are a couple of entrepreneur geeks trying to make our own little dent in the universe. George pioneered the mag stripe credit card reader in the 80's, took his company Hypercom public, and revolutionized the way we pay. Will created the first company to turn mobile phones into payment terminals with Way Systems and he built ROAM Data with the same spirit of ingenuity. Now, the two have teamed up to solve the biggest challenge facing mobile payments today: how to turn your phone into a wallet that works, for any consumer, ‰ÛÏright now‰Û. Loop is  the first company that has solved this enormous challenge and now we need your backing to help us put this innovation in your hands so you can go from a big fat wallet or pocketbook, to the convenience of carrying only your phone (and some cash if you‰Ûªre feel old fashioned!)
The Problem and the Breakthrough: 
So why hasn‰Ûªt anyone solved this problem yet? It‰Ûªs because getting a phone to talk with the tens of millions of credit card readers has never been done before. Big companies have spent millions of dollars creating new mobile transmission technologies that require expensive changes to each credit card reader, costing every store hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Store owners have no incentive to change their systems to accept new technologies that few consumers are using, and consumers are not going to adopt a solution that they can‰Ûªt use where they shop every day. So no merchant adoption equals no consumer adoption ‰ÛÒ it‰Ûªs a deadlock.
Until...one day George and Will were discussing the problems with new mobile wallet technologies like Near Field Communication, and George had the idea of using the reliable and faithful ‰ÛÏmag stripe reader‰Û, the one that every credit card reader already has. The idea was to treat the mag stripe reader as a receiver to accept transmissions from a phone or accessory using a magnetic induction loop. At the time, no one in the industry thought this was possible. Through lots of trial and error in his lab, George was able to make the first contactless mag stripe transmission work in December of 2012 and dubbed it Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST). Will then recruited a team of really smart veterans from MIT and around the world and everyone got cracking. The Loop team made our first successful consumer transaction at Beacon Grill in Woburn, MA in March of this year. 
Will was ecstatic, as he had been working on mobile payments for a decade, and this was a true breakthrough. The two immediately filed patents and got to work figuring out how to leverage this new technology to create a convenient and secure mobile wallet solution for consumers. Nearly a year later, after proof of concept, we‰Ûªre close to bringing our first products to market.
The Beginning: 
As entrepreneurs always do, Will and George moved quickly to put the MST technology into action and integrated it with exiting products in order to test the concept.  The first ChargeCase was created by building the MST technology in a Mophie JuicePack and our first Fob was built into an existing audio-jack Magnetic Stripe Reader. With these two models we were able to prove that the Loop works at over 90% of existing credit card readers.  We are now ready to manufacture the production quality products.
Our first prototype units of the Loop Fob and ChargeCase.
How does it work? 
The MST technology generates changing magnetic fields over a short period of time.  This is accomplished by putting alternating current through an inductive loop, which can then be received by the magnetic read head of the credit card reader. This signal received emulates the same magnetic field change over time as when a magstripe card is swiped across the same read head. Loop works within 4 inches from the read head; the field dissipates rapidly beyond that point, and only exists during a transmission initiated by the user (as opposed to NFC).     
Here is a peak under the hood of the Loop Fob with the Fob PCB:
The guts of the Loop Fob.
How are cards loaded and used? 
You can swipe all YOUR mag stripe cards into the Loop Fob via the integrated card reader into a secure memory.  We supply a separate audio jack reader to do the same with the Loop ChargeCase.  Then use the LoopWallet app to select the card you want to use, place the Loop near the credit card reader, and hit the transmit button on the screen or device. The signal will be sent and the credit card machine will accept the transmission.
Loop Features: 
Loop gives you control of what you put in your mobile wallet.  Just load your cards as described above (credit, debit, gift, membership, loyalty) into a secure memory in your Loop Fob or ChargeCase. Use your LoopWallet app to organize and manage your cards. You can even take photos of your IDs, Membership Cards, and even your receipts.  The LoopWallet app also allows you to store your passwords in a centralized location. The Loop can only be unlocked with your PIN.
Your LoopWallet is password protected.
You have complete control over what cards to use, and when to use them, just like a regular wallet. You can also transmit a ‰ÛÏdefault‰Û card that you select by simply pressing the transmit button on the Loop Fob or ChargeCase. The Loop already works at more than 90% of retailers. Due to our extensive field-testing, even before we ship, we know that the Loop works all around the US and internationally as well.

Production Plan: 
We are currently beta testing our first 100 Loop Fobs that were produced using rapid prototype plastics (kind of like printing in 3D). Currently, the production tooling for the Loop Fob is in progress and will be ready in early November. We will do a small production run to proof our tooling design in mid-November. We will make adjustments to the tooling, if necessary, to finalize the design. Once proofed, we will be ready for full production and have the capability to produce 10,000 units a day. Since the Loop ChargeCase is derived from the integration of the Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) module with an existing case with backup battery power, we have also been able to quickly produce 100 Loop ChargeCases. These units are available today for beta testing that will begin in mid to late October. Based on inputs from our users, we will make necessary improvements by the end of December. We will then start full production in mid-January.
We need your backing to produce our first production runs and get this great new solution in your hands. In order to meet and exceed customer delivery expectations, our plan is to produce 10,000 Loop Fobs by December 2013 and 10,000 Loop ChargeCases by February 2014. Follow-on orders will be filled as soon as they come off the production line. Backers can rest assured Will and George have a long history of bringing quality products to market and this product will be no different. While at ROAM data, Will was producing and delivering 15,000 units a day of his magnetic card readers for mobile phones. The current production capacity of the Loop ChargeCase is 1,500 units per day. If there are any unexpected delays in the production and fulfillment process, we promise to keep our backers informed as we will work diligently to put amazing Loop products in your hands.

Rico + the planet
Rico aims to disrupt how we consume electronics.
For the average consumer, the shelf-life of a smartphone is 24 months. According to IDC, of the over 280 million smartphones that were sold last year, many will be replaced without being recycled. These phones are toxic to the environment, polluting the air and contaminating soil and water with metals and plastics. What‰Ûªs worse is that over 90% of these will be in perfect working order.
We value it essential to be able to reuse electronics when they would either remain unused or discarded altogether. Why not use that same device in such a way that not only prevents wastage, but gives you more features than before? Thanks to Rico, this is possible, with the life of your old smartphone suddenly beginning again.
Rico + features
Rico aims to disrupt smart-home security.
Rico combines the power of an inbuilt processor with the best features of your smartphone to create an entirely new device.

If you missed out on your opportunity to back our Kickstarter campaign, you can still pre-order Everykey from our website and get $25 off retail price. Just click the link above to go there now.
Everykey is an innovative universal access device for everything that requires a physical key or password. The Everykey wristband is an attractive Bluetooth enabled band that allows immediate access to a user‰Ûªs password-protected electronics such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer, as well as physically locked items including doors, car doors, bike locks, and other controlled access devices. 
When the Everykey wristband is within range of a user's device, the wristband will allow the user to bypass that device's password or physically unlock it automatically, eliminating the need for complicated passwords and cumbersome keys.
Everykey also manages a password keychain, which can be used to seamlessly log the user into their online accounts when they‰Ûªre close to one of their devices. When the wristband goes out of range, the device automatically re-enables security mechanisms so it is safe and secure when out of trusted hands.
Everykey utilizes military grade encryption, allowing only you access to your personal property and accounts. Like a credit card, you can instantly disable your Everykey if it ever gets lost or stolen.
Welcome to the revolution of access control.
We designed Everykey from the ground up with fashion as our north star. We applied the same methods as a haute couture fashion brand, placing meticulous attention to detail with absolute precision, resulting in an elegant and sleek product without compromise in aesthetic or performance. Each beautiful color option has been carefully refined to reflect a unique personality. Our continued obsession with design and usability extends to every other aspect of the Everykey experience.
Our belief is that wearable electronics should be as fashionable as they are functional. That‰Ûªs why we have our designers work closely with our engineers to create a seamless product experience. Fitting electronics inside such a small form factor is a challenge, and we‰Ûªve worked really hard to bring our electronics down to a compact size.
Protecting Your Passwords
The passwords to your devices are never stored on an Everykey server or on the wristband. The wristband broadcasts encrypted information to identify itself, which only your devices are able to decrypt. The passwords to your devices are stored on the devices themselves in an encrypted form within a keychain. This is similar to the way in which your phone stores its own password for verification against user password input. In order for Everykey to seamlessly enter your website passwords across multiple devices, your website passwords are stored on an Everykey secure server in an encrypted form. Only your devices and wristband know this key, so there‰Ûªs no way for our company to decrypt your passwords. You can always choose which passwords Everykey stores and which it doesn‰Ûªt.
Encryption
Everykey utilizes AES 128-bit encryption, the same encryption that‰Ûªs used by websites that require your credit card information in order to make purchases online. AES 128-bit encryption is a tried and true encryption method. Only your wristband and the devices it unlocks hold the encryption key. Our company doesn‰Ûªt have access to that encryption key and therefore, we have no way of decrypting your passwords.
Lost Everykey Deactivation
If you lose your Everykey, you can call us or go online to deactivate it. After you‰Ûªve deactivated your wristband, a message is immediately sent to all of your devices letting them know that they should not unlock for your wristband. In the meantime, your devices will still unlock with your old keys and passwords.
Spoof Prevention
Everykey broadcasts an encrypted Bluetooth 4.0 message at least once every second. Each time this message is broadcast, it‰Ûªs changed, preventing a hacker from sniffing a message and re-broadcasting it. Because each message is encrypted, there‰Ûªs no way to derive one message from the previous message, so each encrypted message that‰Ûªs broadcast is non-deterministic and pseudorandom. Your devices will only unlock for the most recent message, so a hacker is unable to unlock your devices by re-broadcasting an old message. Only devices that you‰Ûªve set up with your Everykey will have the ability to interact with your Everykey, all other connections are rejected. A device still has to verify it‰Ûªs legitimacy through an encrypted handshake in order to interact with your wristband.
Website password management is compatible with all iOS 8+ devices, a jailbroken version of iOS is required for Everykey to unlock the device itself. Windows 8.1+ computers with built in Bluetooth 4.0 are compatible with Everykey, a specific Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle is required for computers running Windows 7 and Windows 8.0. All other operating systems and web browsers are compatible with Everykey on devices that are Bluetooth 4.0 enabled.
The following three technology demos are unedited and demonstrate our Bluetooth 4.0 circuit board that fits inside the Everykey wristband being used to unlock devices and log into websites. The circuit board is being powered by our custom bent lithium-polymer battery.

Everykey was originally a school project in an entrepreneurship class at Case Western Reserve University in September, 2012. After receiving a rave response from our class and our professor, we started developing the product and founded Everykey LLC, a Cleveland, Ohio based company. The CWRU Blackstone LaunchPad and Burton D. Morgan Foundation JumpStart Mentoring Program have helped us grow from an idea into a business. In the summer of 2013, we received The GLIDE Innovation Fund A Grant to help build the technology that's showcased in the main product video as well as our tech demos.
All your passwords, securely stored and automatically sent to any device you wish to use, so you don't have to worry never again!
Passfort is a security device, designed as a keychain so you‰Ûªll always carry it with you, just as your car, home or office keys. It works with all your everyday devices: mobile or computer, and with all your favorite platforms.
Passfort includes a free Sync App that will work on Mac OS, Windows, iOS and Android. This app will walk you through the initial setup process and allow you to easily create and transfer all your existing service accounts. 
Passfort allows you to store all your accounts from any service or app. If it has a password, rest assured Passfort can store it. It can even store a third field, making it possible to manage even your credit cards! 
We are including a bunch of icons preloaded for you to easily identify your accounts, but you may always add you own custom images.
In order to gain access to your accounts on Passfort, you must use your Master Key. It can be either a 4 to 8 digit numeric key or a 4 to 8 images based key, of your choosing. However, it has been proven that it‰Ûªs easier for people to remember images. So for your image based Master key, you‰Ûªll choose one image within each chosen category. 
When authenticating, Passfort will display a multiple-choice question for each category. This makes it pretty easy for you while imposing a challenge to others. 
If someone tries to login to your Passfort and fails, its security mechanism will block it for a user configurable time preventing user access. 
After the specified (user configurable) maximum failed login retries, Passfort will erase all your stored data preventing access to your accounts. Before reaching the last retry to activate the auto-erase feature, you may configure your Passfort to be blocked for several hours. 
You may always restore your data using the encrypted backup generated by our free Sync App.
In case someone cracks open your Passfort and intends to extract your accounts information directly from the device‰Ûªs internal memory, fear not, your data is securely stored encrypted with the same method used by Security Agencies to protect classified information. 
As you probably saw on our video, we already have a fully functional Passfort circuit prototype along with a 3D printed housing. 
From left to right: 1) First Proof of Concept prototype, 2) Final Prototype Circuit Board, 3) Passfort Prototype assembled.
Passfort comes in different colors. After the campaign ends, you will be asked to choose the one you like: 
As for our SPECIAL LIMITED EDITION, you can have your desired color image or texture printed on the back of your PASSFORT.

Wearsafe: Wearable Personal Safety
With the press of a wearable button, Wearsafe instantly alerts, informs and connects your most trusted network so they can send help when you need it. Being prepared allows you to safely embrace all of life‰Ûªs adventures!
Safety for your [whole] life
Alerts sent to those you trust, and who can best decide how to help you.
When activated, an alert is instantly sent to the members of your selected network.  It includes critical information like your location, speed of travel, streaming audio, and creates a private group chat so your friends and family can easily communicate with each other and share information.
Long Range
Statistics show that in a distress event, even if your smartphone is taken away from you, it will typically be within 35 feet from you.  The Wearsafe Tag has a range of up to 200 feet to ensure you're connected and able to send out an alert. 
Discreet, Wearable Activators
Wearsafe Tag: For a variety of reasons, smartphone users are often faced with situations where their phone is out of reach or they might not want to reveal they are calling for help. A press of the discreet Wearsafe Tag sends an alert for you, from up to 200 feet away from your smartphone. 
A silent vibration lets you know your request for help has been sent, and then again each time someone from your network opens the alert to respond.
You can wear the Wearsafe Tag in many different ways. With the included clip, fabric loop, and ring attachment, you can wear it on your belt, strap, lanyard, or however you prefer. It's versatile and works with your lifestyle, whatever adventure you choose today!  
With the goal of designing something elegantly simple, we looked to nature and explored a combination of fast curves and dynamic, organic shapes as the foundation for a cohesive visual language for the Wearsafe Tag. 
Over the course of a year, we collaborated with leading industrial design firms, including CleverEdge and Interwoven Design Group, a NY industrial design firm led by Rebeccah Pailes-Friedman, a 15 year veteran of product design and former Design Director for Fila, Champion and Nike. Rebeccah also happened to be the founding director of the Intelligent Materials Applied Research & Innovation (IMARI) Lab and Professor of Industrial Design at the Pratt Institute. (We knew we found the right person when Rebeccah initially couldn‰Ûªt meet with us because she was giving lectures on wearable technology at the White House.) 
The end result of a year and a half of design iteration eventually led us to a device that exceeded our expectations in both simplicity and functionality. After all, a device that will protect an irreplaceable asset needs to be both memorable and enviable.
Smartwatches and more: Wearsafe is a safety platform and we developed it to be future-proof.  In addition to using the Wearsafe Tag as your activator, other wearables will work as well, including fitness trackers and smart watches.  Shortly after launch, you will be able to use the Pebble smartwatch or the new Pebble Time watch to send an alert.  In addition, compatibility with Garmin, the Apple Watch and Android Wear will be available in the very near future.  Our goal is to make integrating Wearsafe into your life as easy as possible.  The future of wearables is limitless, and we'll continue to work to ensure that Wearsafe will work with whatever wearable you choose. 
Beyond Your Personal Safety
When a distress situation escalates to the point where first responders are needed, the patent-pending Wearsafe App will provide them with information that can exponentially aid their response. Your network of friends and family can provide 911 dispatchers with a unique alphanumeric code generated by your alert.  By accessing a secure Wearsafe webpage through a mobile or desktop internet browser, 911 dispatchers and first responders can gain full access to the information generated by your alert, in real time.

Thanks for checking out our project page.  We are grateful for everyone's incredible interest and support!
We've been diligently working since summer 2013 to develop ICLOAK‰ã¢, a portable online anonymity tool to give you a fast, convenient and flexible way to browse the Internet anonymously on any computer. 
We've done all the ground work and prototyping and now we need your help to take this baby to market and help folks take back their CHOICE about what's tracked about them and what isn't.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik is your superhero tool that turns any computer you use into a safe and trustworthy computer.  
We've combined a security hardened operating system with a secure web browser, encrypted password management and more, onto a USB drive so you can plug it into any machine (even the most unsafe and virus filled), reboot the machine and start browsing as if you took the time to build a custom computer built for security, privacy and anonymity from scratch! 
Once you finish browsing, unplug, reboot the computer again, and ICLOAK is designed so that no one will ever know you even used that computer.
Below are 3 versions of the product packaging card that we are considering. In the white box in the middle will be a small plastic box that contains the actual USB device below.

Like our t-shirts say... YOU ARE BEING WATCHED.  We are too.  All of the time.  Big Data, Big Brother, Hackers, Ex-Lovers, Employers, Marketing Firms, Stalkers, Identity Thieves, and on and on.  Every day there is another news report about how data is being collected on everyone.
To protect yourself the questions are...
HOW do you change your IP address so it is not tracked everywhere you go?
HOW do you change your Media Access Control (MAC) address so your computer cannot be identified?
HOW do you know if there is HIDDEN software recording your every keystroke on your computer?
HOW do you stop sites from tracking your browser Navigator data profile and tracking your browsing from site to site?
HOW do you protect yourself when you want to?
If you are like most average folks using the Internet every day, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO!  Don't feel bad... neither does anyone else who isn't an Uber Geek like us.
The trouble is, the technology around us has outpaced the normal person's ability to keep up with it all.  Because of this, few people have the knowledge or time to figure out ways to protect their privacy WHEN THEY WANT TO.
It's not always easy to find a computer you can trust.  Many machines have spyware and malware even the owners don't know about and their antivirus cannot detect!  So we asked ourselves, how can we turn every computer you will ever use into a secure and trusted machine when you NEED it?
We needed a way to bypass the computer's hard drive and software and yet utilize all its processing capabilities. This led us to the boot-from-usb method that's been around for a long time.
We figured, if we could somehow build in all the tools you need to browse the Internet securely and anonymously into a SINGLE portable USB drive that works on PCs, Macs, and Linux, we'd have managed to turn almost every machine on the planet into a secure and trusted machine you could use.
Whether you use a computer in the office or a computer at a cyber cafe in Bangkok you will be protected.
We have many ideas about what ICLOAK can do and we'll be working on adding them into the product in the future.  Right now, however, ICLOAK does the following things really well:
1. ICLOAK will mask your IP address.  Period.  All of your data traffic is forced over TOR or I2P anonymizing networks making you appear to be somewhere else than where you really are.
2. ICLOAK gives you the ability to choose a Country to appear to be coming from.  This has many uses including gaining access to content that is blocked in certain jurisdictions.
3. ICLOAK will automatically create a new, random MAC address (this is the hardware identifier for the device you are connecting with) every time you connect to any network.
4. With ICLOAK you can browse anonymously on any 64-bit Windows, Linux or Mac computer without needing to alter those machines.
5. It WILL NOT LEAVE ANY TRACE of your browsing activities on any machine you use.  No cookies, no browser history, no user ids, no log files.
6. ICLOAK Stik is immune to any sort of persistent infections so you will be safe from malware, spyware, viruses and any other malicious software each time you reboot.
7. ICLOAK Stik can store encrypted versions of any usernames and passwords you want to keep safe.  Also, it allows you to keep separate "identity sets" for keeping multiple identities separate from each other.
8. ICLOAK Stik can store files on a "visible" section of the USB drive that can be used to store files you want access to on your regular computer OS or transport from place to place.  (ICLOAK itself is contained in a section hidden from your regular OS).
9. ICLOAK Stik itself cannot store any information about you or what you do with it without your deliberate action.  So even if someone steals your ICLOAK Stik, there will be no information on it about your browsing activities.  NOTE:  If you store passwords, or other files on the unencrypted partition, only that information will be retrievable by someone else if they get your Stik.
Here's an infographic we put together to demonstrate how ICLOAK works.
Why iCloak?
There are literally dozens of these but we'll only list what we think are the top ten online threats ICLOAK can help protect you from:
1. Identity theft
2. Silent monitoring of your camera and microphone
3. IP address recording
4. Browsing and download history spying
5. Email hacking using malicious cookies and similar scripts
6. Screen captures
7. Password theft through spyware
8. Key-logging software that records your keystrokes.
9. Loss of funds through theft of credit card and bank details
10. Prevent websites from tracking, recording and selling your web usage data to advertisers.
So what's under the hood?
ICLOAK is a made up of both hardware and software components. 
Hardware: The hardware that will go into building ICLOAK is a robust and high quality USB drive manufactured by the largest manufacture of USB drives in the world, Kensington.
It's made from durable aluminum with no moving parts.
One of the things we want to ensure is that your ICLOAK Stik lasts at least 3-4 years with daily or regular use.  With periodic use we expect it to last up to 5 years or longer.
The USB drive is also small and very portable making it easy to carry with you wherever you go.  It is designed to easily slip on a keychain or in your pocket.  
Software:
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik
ICLOAK Stik will come with features to enable you to browse anonymously from any machine.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik will contain ICLOAK‰ã¢ Ring which can be used to store and manage your passwords securely.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik will also contain a separate partition for storage that your regular computer can access.
ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik PRO
In addition to giving you the ability to browse anonymously from any machine, ICLOAK‰ã¢ Stik Pro will also come with additional software so you can:
Create/Edit Excel Spreadsheets in private
Create/Edit Word docs in private
Send/Receive anonymous messages
Store Bitcoins in a secure wallet
Store encrypted usernames and passwords
We are innovators and if there's one place innovation is recognized and supported it's right here on KickStarter.  We are here because we believe we have something that could help millions of people around the world take charge of their online freedom and rights.
ICLOAK is not just a gadget to us, it's an ideal, a philosophy, a statement that says we should have the right and the option to freely participate online. We are here because we hope to find kindred spirits who believe in what we are doing as much as we believe in it ourselves and in the GOOD of what we are doing.  
So jump on board, join a movement that is making a difference for average people everywhere and help us get to our next milestone!
Your amazing contributions will be put towards:
1.  TESTING TESTING TESTING
2.  Having ICLOAK reviewed by a third party for security
3.  Manufacturing the first run with Kingston
4.  Adding additional features
5.  Promoting ICLOAK more broadly
We've done all the groundwork, now we need your help to get this product off the ground and into production. 
Every pledge, big or small will be welcomed with open arms and loads of good karma (and rewards) towards you and yours. 
ICLOAK is right now in Alpha testing and we will soon be releasing a private Beta so we are confident our progress to the final shipped product will be right on schedule.

UPDATE: 
FUNDED! THANK YOU!
Now that we're funded, the next most important success factor for the project will be getting a critical mass of usage.  The more people that back us, the better our chances of seriously changing the web for the better.
And importantly, we have major media that could not cover us before we were funded, so we expect another round of even bigger mentions.  More users and bigger success on funding will now serve to amplify messages like these.
Fast Company: This Open Source Twitter Replacement Is Absolutely Brilliant
Wired Magazine: Crossing Twitter and Google Reader to Create Open Source Love Child
Tech Crunch: Trsst Is A Secure Twitter For The Post-Snowden Internet
Thanks to all of you.  I don't know what else to say.  
Welcome to Trsst: An Open and Secure Alternative to Twitter
Post your thoughts, share links, and follow other interesting people or web sites, using the web or your mobile or any software of your choice.  
All of your private posts to individuals or friends and family are securely encrypted so that even your hosting provider - or government - can't unlock them.
All of your public posts are digitally signed so you can prove that no one - and no government - modified or censored your writings.
You control your identity and your posts and can move them to another site or hosting provider at any time. 
Think of Trsst as an RSS reader (and writer) that works like Twitter but built for the open web.  The public stuff stays public and search-indexable, and the private stuff is encrypted and secured.  Only you will hold your keys, so your hosting provider can't sell you out. 
Trsst fitting in on the open web
Technically speaking, Trsst is a working reference implementation that defines a simple and open standard for secure blogging on the open web.  See our white paper for details or skip to the How It Works section below.  We want you to have lots of different clients and servers to choose from.
But the important twist is that Trsst is built for everyone.  Trsst sites can look and feel like Facebook or Twitter or Tumblr.  And from day one, you can follow all your favorite sites and bloggers that post RSS feeds.  And they'll be able to follow you.  
There will be no reason not to make the switch to the open web.
Your Role
If you think this is at all important, or even interesting, we're asking you to: (1) back it, (2) use it, and (3) get your friends to back it and use it.
A contribution today of any amount is worth ten times as much as a contribution tomorrow because it raises visibility on kickstarter and gets us in front of even more people.
So if you're even thinking about it... please make the leap right now and click the big green button at top-right.
What You Get
You get a fully-functional account on scalable, secure, and consumer-grade RSS-reading and microblogging service with web and mobile web clients hosted at trsst.com that launches on or before December 2013.
You are the initial user base and have a voice in how the project evolves. Reward tiers include reserving your user id and permanent opt-out of all ads or sponsored posts if we ever have to resort to that.  
You are acknowledged (if you want) on our about page as a member of the founding team (or you can remain anonymous).  Even at the lowest tier, it's at least as good as being in the LOTR credits. 
We are going to put a dent in the planet. Take the credit.
Why Bother?
You've read the news.  People are finally waking up to what the rest of us have known for some time: everything everyone does on the internet is being collected and harvested for inevitably nefarious purpose.
Trsst mainstreams good crypto practices and usage among the general consumer audience to make global communications - on the whole and in the aggregate - more free, private, and secure.
At the end of the day, every company you trust - Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, or Baidu - is a corporation owned by shareholders and subject to governmental jurisdiction.
At any time, the directors and shareholders of these companies may revoke their promises to you about privacy, and they may do so without even notifying you about it.
At any time, the governments under which these companies operate may enact legislation that appropriates or nationalizes the data in their possession, including your personally identifying information and stored communications. 
This may have already happened.  There is no company not under the jurisdiction of a government.  No place is safe.
The only hope we have is a decentralized cryptography-based messaging infrastructure that no government can control where no corporation need be trusted and all communications are encrypted and only you hold the decryption keys.  
We have the technology.  And the time is now.
Revolutions are started on social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Dissidents, informants, confidential sources, journalists, and those they trust all rely on these services.  Trsst will better preserve their causes, their freedom, their livelihood, and even their lives.
I hope you will agree that this needs to happen and back the project.
How It Works
Very simply, this project will fund:
Extending RSS/Atom to support self-signed and self-encrypted entries.
Specifying a convention for requesting and relaying RSS entries using https.
Building the reference implementations of the client and the server.
It's very simple because we are using and extending existing web standards.  We will host the first fully-conforming trsst server, and develop an open source web client including javascript libraries for core functionality like the cryptographic functions. 
We want to encourage existing twitter client developers to port their software to support this platform with their bold and innovative UIs. We want to encourage others to host their own servers to be part of the syndicated network.
Trsst averting surveillance, monitoring, and firewalls.
From the user perspective, it's going to look and feel like a Twitter clone. The use cases and functionality are straightforward and familiar.
From a high-level perspective:
Each user's client generates a keystore with a keypair for each account.  Each account maps to a blog.  The account's public key is the unique identifier.
The account keypair is also a bitcoin address, making each trsst client effectively a bitcoin wallet, whether the user realizes it or utilizes it or not.  
A user posts entries to an account either publicly or privately.  Public posts are signed with your private key; private posts are encrypted with the recipient's public key.  
Each post contains the message digest of the previous post so you can verify that no posts are modified or missing.  We call this the blogchain.  
You publish your posts by pushing them to one or more servers that are participating in the syndication network.  Servers serve up portions of your blogchain as an RSS feed.
Following means subscribing to an account's RSS feed using their public key as an identifier.  This is how you see private messages meant for you.
Any server in the syndication network can serve the feed to you, fetching it from cache or from other servers in order to route around network congestion or firewalls and blacklists.
All of the above is transparent to the user. From sign-up to day-to-day usage, the user thinks it works just like Twitter or Facebook or however a custom client decides to render the schema to make their users happiest.
We are open to smart ideas from smarter people and things may evolve during the course of development.
For detail on how we expect things will work behind the scenes, please see the white paper.
Development Timeline
From a user perspective, the end result is a web client for mobile and desktop browsers backed by a scalable server infrastructure.  (We would lean on third-parties to provide native clients, mobile apps, et al.)
We expect to let you start using the site as soon as we get a minimally functional version.  This would happen several weeks before the delivery date or sooner if funding allows.  Afterward, we would add features on a rolling basis. 
From the back-end perspective, all public user-generated content must be consumable by off-the-shelf RSS readers like Feedly.  We don't expect you to give up your friends to use our service.
We develop organically: first, we get it working; then we get it working right. The aim is to have this base feature set deployed by December 2013, or before then if we exceed the funding goal.
Use of Funds
We're reserving $15K for server/hosting costs over the next year plus, and the remainder goes to fund six person-months of development time for a three-month delivery window for the initial minimally viable product, which is comparable in cost to projects we love like Mailpile, but less due to shorter timeframe.
Subtract from that one-time campaign costs including: 3% to 5% for payment processing from Amazon, Kickstarter's 5% fee, and up to $5K for fulfillment of the handsome T-shirts.
Any funds raised beyond the target amount will be used to add resources to: accelerate the delivery timeline, broaden the feature set, expedite the interoperability, speed the standardization process, and bolster adoption; each of which is essential to achieve the broader goal of making the vision into reality.  
Is it enough? We've targeted the "minimally viable" feature set for the funding amount. This is the minimum needed to kickstart the vision. We hope you will help us exceed that goal by a non-trivial amount.
We get the "is it too much?" question about as much as we get the "is it enough?" question, which makes us think we're asking for the right amount.
How do we know you will actually get this launched?
I have a track record of launching companies and shipping software, most recently Hotel Me and AppTap.  This team has the same players.
I also habitually launch other kinds of projects as well, like my modestly popular iOS apps 3-Card Brigade Poker and Speaking Spelling Bee.
Again, nothing I have done before has been close to as important for the world that I want to live in as the Trsst Project.
Questions and Answers
Why give you money? 
Maybe you love the web and want to support open standards in the face of encroachment. Maybe you believe in freedom and privacy. Maybe you have a heart of gold. Maybe you have a vault of gold. All of these are good reasons. 
No, why give *you* money? 
Because our team has the skill set and track record and just plain *motivation* to get this done.  Take a look at my bio to see the kinds of things I've accomplished.  None of them is as important to me as this.
Are you asking for enough money?
We've targeted the "minimally viable" feature set for the funding amount.  This is the minimum needed to literally "kickstart" the vision.  We hope you will help us exceed that goal by a non-trivial amount.
Can't you get some volunteers to do this for free? 
Like everyone else, I don't want to be spending time on something no one wants. As opinion research shows, the surest way to measure actual opinion is when it's backed by actual money, even just a few bucks. That's one of the things I like best about about Kickstarter: trust but verify. I want to believe.
Why do you need the money? 
You are kickstarting development and server resources. And let's not kid ourselves: a few guys in suburban DC developing yet another blog platform aren't going to reach a meaningful number of users out of thin air. But if there were five thousand influencers like you contributing $12 each, that's the beginnings of a solid community. Paul Graham says at ten thousand we'd be unstoppable.  And a funded Kickstarter project has a way of attracting attention and building a following. 
What about app.net or one of the many of other teams with a similar idea?  
We're all on the same team: working for the open and secure web.  We will adopt existing standards -- HTTPS, RSS, OStatus -- extending only if necessary.  We will use whatever existing software we can.  We want everyone to interoperate with lots of choices.  And the only way to affect that kind of change is to write working software, now. 
We aim to push the envelope in what we think is the right direction, and we think our approach has the greatest potential for rapid adoption and success.
Simple, Secure & Anonymous.
Despite increasingly robust solutions from software giants in the antivirus space and the collaborative efforts of Internet security players - including government and private initiatives - no effort has succeeded in creating an impenetrable layer of security between a web browser and a computer or corporate network. Why? Incremental virus software improvements are not the solution. 
The only way to protect a machine or network from Internet-borne criminal mischief is to physically block its exposure to the Internet. How can a machine be physically blocked from the Internet and still be online?
Meet Webcloak‰ã¢
Webcloak‰ã¢ is a small USB device with a distinctive form factor containing a technical architecture that shifts the paradigm in web security by creating the most impenetrable barrier between a client machine and the Web. Featuring a game changing combination of hardware, encryption and "secure access" software, Webcloak‰ã¢ provides a physical shield that allows users to safely browse the Web while being protected from viruses, data theft or identity theft - it essentially makes you invisible.  With an incomparable configuration of hardware and software, Webcloak‰ã¢ not only protects your computer from Internet threats, but also protects you from hostile applications on the host computer - the product simply stops any incoming access to the host machine. Webcloak‰ã¢ does not install any software on your computer, you simply plug it in and the protection begins. No need to restart your computer, Webcloak‰ã¢ works without rebooting! When you shutdown Webcloak‰ã¢ there is no trace of it or your Internet activity left behind.
Webcloak‰ã¢ Protects You Against:
Also protects you from:
"SideJacking" - Wi-Fi Session Hijacking
Network Traffic Sniffing
DNS Spoofing
Key-loggers and Screen Scrapers
"Man in the Middle" Attacks
Site Visit Tracking Code
Cryptolocker and All Other Ransomware
All Viruses and Exploits
What Makes Webcloak‰ã¢ Unique?
WebCloak creates the most impenetrable barrier between you and the web. It‰Ûªs our mission to provide a completely safe, secure and anonymous online experience. In order to do so, we took a step back to view the whole picture: what currently exists in the realm of internet security, what are people doing, what works, what doesn‰Ûªt work and what‰Ûªs missing? Where are the holes? Where are the vulnerabilities? Most solutions focus on monitoring, detection and mitigation, meaning you‰Ûªve already been compromised, how can you minimize the damage? You have the wound, how can you stop the bleeding? Our goal is to make sure you never reach that point. Webcloak‰ã¢ uses a ground-up, combination of hardware, encrypted hardware virtualization and a game changing encrypted communications system coupled with a custom cloud enabled Internet desktop operating system.  You may have seen products on the market that claim to protect you while using the Internet by using encrypted thumb drives and "portable browsers" or bootable thumb drives and dubious free anonymity software. These products offer limited to no protection and can be difficult to use, all while providing a false sense of security which makes you more vulnerable.
How Does Webcloak‰ã¢ Work?
The device encases an "Internet desktop" running a secure virtual operating system. By plugging Webcloak‰ã¢ into your computer, it forms a "machine within the machine". Unlike conventional web browsing, with Webcloak‰ã¢ the Web is not able to identify or access your computer in any way, shape or form. Webcloak‰ã¢ protects information as it travels to and from the Internet using our SafeChannel message encryption system. All data is encrypted using a customized version of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption which is rated by the National Security Agency (NSA) as "Top Secret" level encryption, their highest rating. With Webcloak‰ã¢ do your banking and make online purchasing without fear of data theft, virus infection or vandalism.
Data is protected as it passes through the host system to and from the Internet.
Step 1: Plug Webcloak‰ã¢ Into Your Computer

A Growing Issue
Each year the Internet becomes more dangerous, attacks by hackers become bolder and more sophisticated. The risk of infections by viruses/spyware and the cost to individuals/companies are increasing at an alarming rate. The computer and Internet security industries have simply not been able to keep pace in combating this new generation of attacks. Key industry experts are speaking out about the problem, but lack solutions.
If You Are Browsing, You Are Vulnerable - When browsing the Internet users unknowingly step into a cyber-war zone exposing their data and hardware infrastructures. Open a browser to the Internet and you open a doorway that swings two ways - outward toward the vastness of the Internet and inward toward the guts of your machine. While your browser enables you to go anywhere on the Internet, your browser simultaneously allows cunning wrongdoers to go anywhere inside your computer network.
There are new "Root-kit" viruses that can take over your computer and operate undetected by you, your operating system or your anti-virus software. There are "Botnets" that use the machines of unsuspecting computer users as robots to systematically attack governments and large institutions.
Identity theft, fraudulent transactions, lost productivity and stolen photos are major and growing issues. According to the FTC, identity theft and fraudulent transactions now cost individuals and companies more than $80 billion annually in the U.S. alone. It is estimated that more than 50% of computers are infected by at least one virus, malware or spyware program. With the explosive growth of Internet use comes the exponential growth of Internet attacks. The threat is hyper-real, ubiquitous and costly.
Have you ever clicked a link to realize that you have unleashed a virus on your computer? Do you know anyone who has been the victim of identity theft? We understand your fear.
 The Team
Our team is committed to delivering the best level of computer security and have been working hard for the last 3 years with leading experts in cyber-security and encryption specialists.

He has pioneered the technologies for delivering automated software updates over the Internet and for delivering interactive media to web browsers - years before Flash and Shockwave.
Mr. Dawson has designed and developed proprietary software for companies such as Microsoft, Intel and Citrix. Additionally, software created by Mr. Dawson has been part of a tool set pre-installed on Dell, Micron and Gateway computers.
"My first ‰ÛÏshrink wrap‰Û product came out in the late 80‰Ûªs and was called "Quickstudy for Lotus 1-2-3", which included over 60 highly interactive software simulation based tutorials on a single diskette. You learned how to use software by interacting with a complete simulation of the software. If you had 1-2-3 installed on your computer, Quickstudy would create an interface which allowed you to launch the tutorials from within 1-2-3‰Ûªs menus and dialog boxes. In the early 90‰Ûªs at a Comdex show (a computer tech gathering) the hall was abuzz with talk of the pre-release of a new graphical ‰ÛÏWeb Browser‰Û called Mosaic. I was intrigued and immediately acquired a copy. I realized that because of the component based object oriented nature of my simulation engine I could potential adapt it to ‰ÛÏstreaming‰Û media for the World Wide Web. I succeeded and ‰ÛÏLearnFlow‰Û was born. LearnFlow allowed us to stream our interactive content along with audio and other multi-media formats over a common modem connection. When Microsoft released its new ‰ÛÏMicrosoft Office‰Û website we were asked to provide our technology and create content for their on-line demos. This was years before Flash and Shockwave. I didn‰Ûªt stop there" - Read more‰Û_

LogmeOnce Secure USB Technology & Specifications:
The power of LogmeOnce Secure USB is in the marriage and integration of hardware and software. Our secure USBs are specially manufactured based on LogmeOnce‰Ûªs specifications and requirements, employing standard and existing USB 2.0 technology.
As part of the manufacturing process, LogmeOnce supplies our USB vendor an identification with a token for each USB called Security Data Object technology or SDO (a patent pending technology). SDO is burned on the USB during the manufacturing process and facilitates secure communications and activity between the USB and software.
The embedded SDO in each USB is a security identification token that gets activated upon software registration and paired up with a user‰Ûªs unique credentials to ensure maximum security and privacy. LogmeOnce software detects any tampering with the USB via embedded security architecture and SDO.
We have interviewed multiple USB manufacturers and selected vendors that provide the most flexibility in manufacturing and integration capabilities to meet LogmeOnce security requirements.

What is JackPair?
JackPair is an affordable tool that enables average citizens to protect themselves against wiretapping.  It‰Ûªs a pair of encryption devices you put in between your phone and headset, which are connected through standard 3.5mm audio jacks. You can secure your phone line by simply pushing the JackPair button, and your voice will be encrypted. There‰Ûªs no password to remember, no software to install, no service to subscribe to, and it works with any phone through a standard audio jack.
JackPair in the News
From Bruce Schneier:
"JackPair is a clever device encrypts your voice between your headset and the audio jack. The crypto looks competent, and the design looks well-thought-out. I'd use it."
TechCrunch - "The concept is pretty simple: one box plugs into your phone, whether that‰Ûªs a smartphone, landline telephone or VoIP client on a PC, via the standard 3.5mm headphone jack ..."
Ars Technica - "JackPair is part of a wider movement that has struggled against a darker facet of the Internet‰ÛÓthe ease with which it can be monitored."
eWeek - "The hardware approach of cryptography still has a lot of appeal in establishing secure communications."
TechnologyTell - "How it works is simple."
TechFaster - "Whether you‰Ûªre in any of the professions above or you‰Ûªre just concerned about your privacy, JackPair is definitely worth considering."
[Update]
Many viewers have expressed that the current look of JackPair can be improved.  So we have worked with professional design firms and come up with a few new designs proposals here:
You can vote and comment here on Facebook, leave your feedback in the KS comment section, or contact me for your remarks. We'll pick a winning proposal based on your feedback here and use it as the final industrial design for JackPair.

Affordable Tool For Everyone
The existing secure phones on the market today cost anywhere from over six hundred to a few thousand dollars.  It's out of reach for most people, and the worst part is that, you have to give up the phones you're using everyday, and switch to whatever secure phone models dictated by the vendors.  With JackPair, we're enabling every citizen to protect our own privacy by making it under a hundred bucks, and you get to keep using your favorite phones while talking through JackPair's Secure Line.
One-Click Solution
Using JackPair, you can easily protect your privacy by just pushing the JackPair button.  During a phone call, if both sides have JackPair installed, either side can simply push the JackPair button to pair up the two JackPair devices. This triggers JackPair to encrypt your voice conversation using a One-Time-Secret -Key (OTSK) that is created on the fly. The same OTSK is automatically-created and self-destroyed at both ends without leaving the JackPair box.  This means you don‰Ûªt have to remember any password, and no one can break into your conversation without this One-Time-Secret-Key.
No Trace Left Behind
At any time during your phone call, when you push the JackPair button, a new One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK) is generated to encrypt your voice conversation.  This OTSK is created locally in each of the JackPair devices at both ends of the phone call without being exposed over the network(*), and it is destroyed immediately after the phone call is finished, without being stored anywhere outside the JackPair device.  The OTSK is short-lived and self-managed;  it never leaves the JackPair box.  So there is no chance for the OTSK to be compromised by anybody, whether intentionally or accidentally.  This simple security design leaves no trace behind; it not only protects your voice, but also saves us, as the device maker, from the trouble of being harassed by the government or exploited by hackers.
Besides key exchange protocols, the encryption algorithm in JackPair is based on Salsa20 stream cipher, which is selected by eSTREAM, the ENCRYPT Stream Cipher Project organized by the European Union, as part of its final software portfolio since 2008.  Stream Cipher like Salsa20 is a natural fit with OTSK, which is used as the seed for PRNG (Pseudo Randon Number Generator) to create key streams with similar property of One-Time Pad.  JackPair uses open source encryption software and will stay open sourced.
(*): The One-Time-Secret-Key in JackPair is generated using Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange protocol, which is a well-known, fundamental protocol in the security industry since 1976; it allows creation of shared secret without exchanging it over the network (see illustration below).
Direct With No Middleman
JackPair is designed with end-to-end security in mind: there‰Ûªs no relay server or service provider involved in either the voice encryption or the One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK) creation, and the OTSK is never disclosed anywhere, not even to the other party on the phone call.  In order to make sure both sides use the same OTSK for voice encryption and there‰Ûªs no middleman bridging the call, the Pairing Code(*) is designed as a simple way for both parties to authenticate each other through their own voices over the same phone phone.  After your JackPair device has paired up with the other party‰Ûªs (ie, when the LED light turns from red to green), The first thing you should do is to read the Pairing Code on your screen to the other party over the phone, and verify that the Pairing Code is the same on both ends.  The fact that the other party recognizes your voice and acknowledges with the same Pairing Code means these two JackPair devices are directly connecting with each other, with no middleman bridging the call through any other JackPair devices.
(*): Pairing Code is the abbreviated hash digest number of One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK).
Work With Any Phone
JackPair is a standard audio adapter that can be plugged into any phone with a headset and microphone. At any time during a phone call, both parties can plug in the JackPair device to continue their conversation in secure mode over the same call.  JackPair is connected with phones through its 3.5 mm audio jack, which is the universal standard as the audio interface for all kinds of devices, including all tablets, laptops, personal computers, and most mobile phones & Voice-Over-IP devices.  For plain old telephone sets, JackPair also includes a RJ9-to-3.5mm converter for handset-free operation(*). Unlike other security devices on the market that are hard to use and work only with specific phones or carriers, JackPair is compatible with all of your favorite phones today. With JackPair, you don‰Ûªt have to make the trade-off between personal security and life style.
(*): optional accessories included in Full Pack only.
In addition to the 3.5mm audio jack, we also have Bluetooth in our pipeline for the second-generation JackPair. This will make it even easier for you to protect your voice while keep using your favorite phones & gadgets, and it will also prevent Bluetooth headsets from being eavesdropped, since your voice is encrypted by JackPair before it‰Ûªs transmitted through Bluetooth headsets.  Stay tuned for more update on Bluetooth.
Open Source Security
We plan to make it open source for the encryption software in JackPair. This allows our code to be scrutinized by the community and, if there‰Ûªs any security hole, it‰Ûªll be identified & fixed quickly. We understand that security cannot be taken for granted and requires constant vigilance, and open source is a great way for the community to help out and for us to stay alert. 

In addition to open source software, we intend to do open hardware for JackPair as well.  The schematics and gerber-files will be publicly available to make it easier for everyone to review.  The licenses we are considering so far is Creative Commons - Attribution - ShareAlike 3.0.  Let us know if you have better ideas here.


Why JackPair? I Have Nothing to Hide
The right to privacy is not just about ‰ÛÏsecrecy‰Û or ‰ÛÏhaving something to hide‰Û. With modern surveillance technologies, the Government‰Ûªs massive data collection and mining programs are problematic even if people have nothing to hide. The large-scale harvest of small bits of seemingly innocuous data allows weaving of a much more telling big picture of individuals, but it often failed to reflect the whole story.   The problem lies in not only information ‰ÛÏgathering‰Û, but also information ‰ÛÏprocessing‰Û, and here‰Ûªs some examples you should worry about:
Distortion & Misinterpretation: What if the government mistakenly determines that, based on your pattern of activities, you‰Ûªre likely to engage in a criminal act? What if the government thinks your financial transactions look odd‰ÛÓeven if you've done nothing wrong‰ÛÓand freezes your accounts?
Leaking & Secondary Use: What if the government or carrier operator leaks your information to third-parties or the public? What if the government doesn't protect your information with adequate security, and an identity thief obtains it and uses it to defraud you? How long will personal data be stored? And what can it be used for in the future? A lot of times we do not even know about the leakage of our records until long after the damage is done.
Exclusion of Access: Most data gathered by the government is kept secret for national security reasons, and people are barred from accessing and correcting errors in that data. What if the government denies you the right to fly without giving you any reason?
An argument could be that the government does not intend to hurt average citizens. In many cases that is true, but the government can, and has, also harmed people inadvertently, due to errors, carelessness, or policy changes. These massive surveillance programs are no longer about what information people want to hide; they make the individuals powerless and vulnerable in front of the bureaucracy, and create a power imbalance between People and Government. To change the dynamics, JackPair is the affordable tool that enables average citizens to protect themselves against wiretapping and harassment from Big Brother. 
The Story Behind JackPair
JackPair is inspired in large part by Edward Snowden. The first Snowden leak led to the revelation that the NSA collects records of every U.S. phone call under a call log metadata program. It shows that the data collection is no longer about targeted acquisition of information to avert threats. Such a massive scale of surveillance programs has undermined the fundamental American values of freedom and privacy. America is sliding into a state of universal surveillance. This also reminds me of the police state where I grew up, Taiwan. Before the democratic reform, the government could spy on you without reasons and arrest you based on words you have said. Even today, there are still WaterGate-like scandals happening and the politicians get away without any accountability.
With all these breaking news unrolled in front of us, I started to ask myself, what can we do to stop the abusive wiretapping and protect the democracy & freedom we all believe in as Americans? If we can‰Ûªt stop the abuse of power from its root, then what‰Ûªs the next best thing we can do to protect ordinary citizens from being harassed by the abusive power?
As a network security engineer, I've been involved in both sides of the security arm races; on the defense side, I've built computer firewalls and virtual private networks for millions of uses, and on the offensive side, I‰Ûªve designed peer-to-peer protocols and network traversal programs that penetrate those firewalls and VPNs. I know how complex the security technologies can be, and how hard it is for average citizens to make use of the security technologies to defend themselves. Existing solutions available on the market are either too difficult to use, way too expensive, or just not secure at all. So we rolled up our sleeves and built one that‰Ûªs simple, affordable, and compatible with any phone you already have.
This is how JackPair was born.
The Team At Work
AWIT is consists of a small engineering team with high-caliber professionals in the field of distributed networking, embedded systems, peer-to-peer, mobile game, security, and online/web technologies. From the very beginning of this JackPair project, we had the debate of whether it should be a pure software, mobile app solution, or a standalone hardware product.
Evaluation boards for JackPair prototyping
 After surveying the current software solutions on the market, it became clear to us that it‰Ûªs just too easy to break these mobile apps, and both ends of the conversation must use smart phones for it to work. A hardware product built from scratch is the only way to have the security clearance. The current secure phones on the market costs anywhere from over six hundred to a few thousand dollars, which are out of reach for most people. The challenge is how to build a hardware solution that is affordable, easy-to-use, and compatible with most people‰Ûªs existing phones at hand.
Initial Design of JackPair
With the requirements in mind, we set out to find appropriated evaluation boards for our design. I had started off with TI‰Ûªs LaunchPad board, then Dark Shenada, AWIT‰Ûªs guru in embedded system, had taken over and switched to ST Micro‰Ûªs Discovery Boards. We had some initial success there, but it don't meet our requirements for audio channels, and we think we can do better in terms of reducing the component complexity & cost. With help from our friends of professional consultants for schematics and gerber-file PCB layout, we began to put together our own circuit design with minimal components.
JackPair PCB top/side/bottom views
After a few crash and burns, with more helps from team members like Scott and Simon, we are able to pack all the functionality required for JackPair into a small PCB the size of a cigarette lighter. At the same time, Jackie, the Jack of All Trade in AWIT team, has spent time with designer and mechanical engineer to come up with industrial design for the housing of JackPair.

What's Next?
With software & hardware prototypes in place, we have started to talk with our friends and partners in the field of contract manufactures, as well as housing and industrial designs.  AWIT has long-term EMS partners locally right here in Silicon Valley, California, so JackPair will be manufactured and assembled in the United States, although some of the parts like accessory cables might be sourced through non-domestic channels.
We're stretching as far as we can into this project, and the next step is to go into mass production. It costs quite a bit for the tooling & material sourcing in volumes, and we definitely need the Kickstarter community‰Ûªs help now to fund the project and spread the words. So it‰Ûªs time to debut JackPair here at Kickstarter.com.
After a successful Kickstarter campaign, our next step will be to start the custom tooling & PCB manufacturing process, as well as the testing & certifications required for encryption electronics. Here‰Ûªs our road map:
July/August: meet our sponsors at Kickstarter, finalize industrial design and negotiate manufacturing agreements.
September: finalize the mechanical design and place orders for tooling; procurement of electronic parts and materials.
October: pilot productions, tooling build-out, quality verification and certificate qualification.
November: batch manufacturing of PCB, SMT, and housing.
December: assembly and shipment.
  How You Can Help
The cost of tooling, electronic materials, PCB layout, testing and certification approval are quite expensive, and more importantly, in order to make JackPair affordable tool for everyone, we need volume manufacturing with economies of scale to bring down the price of each JackPair device.  Many of our friends have jumped in to help with prototyping of JackPair, and your sponsorship is vital for bringing JackPair to the next step of mass production and making it affordable for ordinary citizens to defend their own right to privacy.  So please pledge your support to make JackPair the tool for everyone.
                     Dragon Innovation has done a 3rd-party review of JackPair and has pre-qualified that we're a team that knows our stuff and that we have a manufacturable product.

It all began when our propellerhead, Samuli, fearlessly went to battle against the jumble of wires connecting and controlling his things. Samuli could not fathom how cumbersome and laborious it was to create a useful device out of a kit or components. Nor why he had to always physically connect a wire to it, in order to program updates. So he decided to roll up his sleeves and tackle these problems.
Samuli wondered: Is there a way to control and monitor our environment and devices remotely with a cost effective, minimalistic, and practical solution?
The Riots Platform‰ã¢ consists of the Riots Mama‰ã¢ internet gateway and a variety of Riots Babies‰ã¢ network nodes (e.g., Riots Gyro‰ã¢, Riots Light‰ã¢, Riots Air‰ã¢). One Riots Mama has the ability to manage hundreds of uniquely tasked Riots Babies. Riots Babies monitor and control the environment.
In addition to secure monitoring and control, Riots Cloud‰ã¢ supports remote development, over-the-air updates and debugging. Wireless reprogramming of Riots products for new tasks is also accessible via Riots Cloud.

Riots is European at heart with a flavor of Americanism. The roots are in Finland with design, development and manufacturing expertise. The American component brings a wider market channel, certification experience and real world knowledge to complement the technical proficiency of the Finnish nerds.
During Samuli‰Ûªs home construction, he encountered multiple situations with regards to home automation that both irritated and inspired him. Samuli could not fathom how cumbersome and laborious it was to create a useful device out of a kit or components. Nor why he had to always physically connect wires in order to program updates.
Examples:
Why are manual timers the solution for shower and sauna ventilation?
Why is HVAC controlled through one permanently mounted panel
Why aren‰Ûªt there ready made solutions for checking and remotely locking exterior doors?
Samuli searched the retail market for solutions which would address these issues in a cost effective and minimalistic manner; only finding expensive and complex wire-bound options. His history of developing electronics and building software applications for personal use led him to open source communities. Inspired by what was available, Samuli set his sight on building a solution based on Atmel chips.
In the quest to attain his vision, the Samuli sought to combine the capabilities of the versatile platforms (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino) with the readily available breakout board offerings (e.g. sparkfun, adafruit and itead). This led to the founding of Riots Instruments, Inc. and Riots Global Oy and the creation of the Riots Platform. The Riots Platform reduces individual interface exposure to public networks and power consumption, ensures product minimization and is cost effective. Now, you can be among the first in the world to outfit your home or office with smart, IoT technology, allowing you to reduce materials, energy, and water, and save money.

Wallet has been around for a long time since people started to use currency. Its appearance design varies up to different tastes, but its primary function remains unchanged so far. So, what if we add more practical features based on its primary function to make it more Smarter and Safer? Let us introduce a revolutionary SafeWallet.
For example, When a thief is stealing SafeWallet from your pocket, the SafeWallet would warn you immediately. But when you open the SafeWallet by yourself to make payment, or when you go back home and put the SafeWallet on the table, the SafeWallet can recognize you and won‰Ûªt make any noise. This is what we say smarter.
When the SafeWallet is warning, you could easily cancel the warning by tapping the SafeWallet twice, or simply putting the mobile phone close to the SafeWallet.
To implement above functions, We installed many sensors into the SafeWallet, such as light sensor, motion sensor, etc. The SafeWallet integrates dual BLE chipsets simultaneously to avoid annoying false alarm, to ensure better stability. Moreover, We did a lot of experiments and collected accurate data to improve its performance, to make sure the SafeWallet will have perfect user experience.
On the design aspect, we insist to use natural elements, plus latest fashion factors, to make it simple on the surface, but smart inside. About the material, we adopt authentic first class cowhide from England to ensure elegant noble characters.
How does SafeWallet work?
SafeWallet is a real wallet which integrates motion sensor, light sensor, and BLE chipset. It has following functions:
1. Anti-theft
If a thief wants to steal wallet from your pocket or bag, your wallet will beep loudly and your phone will ring loudly to remind you. Also the thief will be scared by the loud beep and stops the stealing. So you can take back the wallet easily. There is only 1 second delay between the stealing and alarm. It is amazing to detect the thief's action so rapidly. Because two light sensors and two motion sensor make that happened.
2: Anti-loss
If you leave your wallet behind, your phone will ring to let you know. If you leave your phone behind, your wallet will beep to let you know. Your wallet and your phone will now be responsible for each other. If you spend the whole weekend staying at home, you can disable anti-loss function by App‰Ûªs No Disturb Mode. In addition, SafeWallet comes with a free App for your phone, which records the time and place when you last lost the SafeWallet.
3: Locating your wallet
If you misplace your wallet, you can use the App to make your wallet ring. With a loud buzzer sound at a volume of over 90dB, you will have no trouble hearing it, even as far as 10 meters away. To allow for a more accurate hunt, the App will also show you the distance between your phone and your wallet.
Principle of anti-theft
SafeWallet has many sensors inside, such as motion sensor, light sensor, etc. There are two light sensors: one is front light sensor, the other one is rear light sensor.
If you put SafeWallet into pocket or in bag, the front or rear light sensor will detect infra-red reflection. So the SafeWallet knows that it is in pocket or bag safely. If the thief take SafeWallet out of pocket or bag, the front and rear light sensor can't detect the reflection. So the SafeWallet knows that it isn't in pocket or bag and beep to remind you. The beep frequency will be more and more intense. If your phone is connected with SafeWallet by BT4.0, your phone will also ring loudly to remind you. So you will know that some one is stealing your wallet. The thief will be scared by the beep and has to drop the wallet.
How does SafeWallet distinguish yourself from thief?
If you take SafeWallet out of pocket, it recognizes you as master on following occasions: 1. Double tap wallet. 2. Open wallet to make payment. 3. Put wallet near by your phone 4. Put wallet on a table. 5 Shake your phone.
The anti-theft warning has 2 stages: pre-warning and loud warning.
Pre-warning
0 - 2 seconds
SafeWallet will beep once every second. Pre-warning is gentle and reminds you that you can cancel pre-warning and loud warning by following ways.
1. Double tap wallet
You can double tap SafeWallet and SafeWallet will cancel pre-warning.
2. Open wallet to make payment
If you open your wallet to make payment, SafeWallet will cancel pre-warning.
3. Put wallet near by your phone
If you take your phone and wallet out of pocket, SafeWallet is near by your phone. So SafeWallet will cancel pre-warning.
4. Put wallet on a table
If you put wallet on a table, SafeWallet will cancel pre-warning. That means if you are at home or office and take wallet out of pocket, you can just put wallet on table to cancel pre-warning.
5. Shake your phone
You can shake your phone and SafeWallet will cancel pre-warning.
Pre-warning mode can be disabled via app setting. This is useful for you if don't want to be disturbed. For example, if you take SafeWallet out of pocket and open wallet within 2 seconds, you will never be disturbed by the beep.
Pre-warning's beep can be replaced by vibration. So you will sense two vibration if you take SafeWallet out of pocket or bag. That remind you to cancel the pre-warning by above 4 methods.
Loud warning
3 - 30 seconds.
SafeWallet will beep faster and faster. The frequency will be more and more intense. So it will scare the thief and remind you.
How to reduce unexpected warning made by anti-loss accessory?
There are more and more anti-loss accessory around the world. But there are many unexpected warnings made by those devices. Because you can't insure that one bluetooth connection with your phone is stable and lasts for 24/7 continually. But if you have two bluetooth connections( 2 BLE chipsets) with your phone at the same time, you can reduce unexpected warning rapidly. Yes, SafeWallet integrates 2 BLE chipsets.
There will be no unexpected warnings during 7 days round-the-clock test. So SafeWallet is no doubt the most stable anti-loss accessory around the world.
Other Features Of SafeWallet
1. Urgent Alert
When you found that your wallet was lost and thought it might be in thief's pocket, you can press "Urgent Alert" button on App and make your wallet ring loudly. So you can locate your wallet by sound. The wallet's warning can not be canceled even if your wallet is disconnected with your phone. You can only cancel warning by App.
2. No Disturb Schedule
When you are at office or at home, you may drop SafeWallet on a table and walk around in a room. Your SafeWallet will lost connection with your phone frequently and there will be many out of range warnings. When you enable no disturb setting, there will be no out of range warning even if you leave your key or phone behind. App's default no disturb interval is 21:00-07:00(next day). So when you sleep at nigh, you will not be disturbed by SafeWallet.
3. Temporary Silence
If you are at office and have a meeting, you‰Ûªd like not to be disturbed by SafeWallet. You can temporarily disable anti-lost function for 5 minutes or 3 hours. SafeWallet App implements the function as following figure shows.
4. Last Known Location
SafeWallet App will record the location where you lost SafeWallet last time. So you could open App and figure out the location of your SafeWallet.
5. Colorful SafeWallet
There are 4 colors of SafeWallet. That will make your SafeWallet unique. The colors include black, brown, yellow and pink.
6. Distance shows on App's dashboard
When you open App, you can figure out the distance between SafeWallet and your phone by the App‰Ûªs dashboard.
7. Wonderful voices make SafeWallet funny
When your phone is far away from SafeWallet, birdcall comes from your phone to call your back. When a thief steals wallet from your pocket, you could hear the trumpet of bus. Also, you could define your personal warning by recording your voice, such as "hey, dude, get my wallet back!"

Why need your help
As you know, SmartWallit team has launched 2 successful campaigns on Kickstarter: SmartWallit and SmartWallit Pro. SmartWallit Pro is our 2nd generation product. It solved the problems of 1st generation product, such as swelling of battery, unstable connection, etc.
But it still has following problems:
1. It is a little thicker than expectation.
2. When a thief is stealing your wallet, SmartWallit Pro can‰Ûªt warn you immediately.
3. There are still some unexpected warnings although SmartWallit Pro is very close to your phone.
4. The battery capacity is not big enough to support long time usage.
SmartWallit team launched this campaign, SafeWallet, to solve all above problems. Also, SafeWallet has other interesting features, such as customized songs.
SmartWallit team will be so glad to know your suggestions about SafeWallet, Please post feedback on the page of SafeWallet campaign. We will consider your suggestions seriously. Please don‰Ûªt hesitate to let‰Ûªs know your good ideas. Thanks in advance.

More than 100 million people play Minecraft and most of them are pre-teens. Do you know who your child is playing Minecraft with? No, you don't. And that's why having a $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ is so important because it makes the game even better while keeping out the pervs.
Minecraft from Mojang (now Microsoft) is a client-server sandbox game that allows children and adults to build things and then, well, blow them up. You can't play true Minecraft without connecting to a server. There are thousands of Minecraft servers on the Internet but most of them are in some way commercial, typically ad-based. That means advertising to your children. 
While every Minecraft server technically has an admin, some do a better job of policing the fun than others. Cyber-bullying on servers is common. The text-based chat in Minecraft can easily get out of hand when players are in survival mode, which generally devolves from building to fighting. A big commercial Minecraft server can have thousands of simultaneous players and if you are a parent there is no way of knowing who is that knave with the diamond sword killing your child and stealing his or her stuff.
But there's a better way -- run your own ad-free Minecraft server. All it takes is an old PC or the server can run in background on Dad or Mom's PC. Multiplayer server software is free from Microsoft. What could be better than that? 
Our $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ is way better.
It's cheaper to run. According to energystar.gov the average home PC costs about $30 per year to run. Our $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ costs about $1 per year to run. Your PC monitor -- just the monitor -- uses about two watts in sleep mode. Our $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ doesn't need a monitor and uses two watts to support 20 simultaneous players.
It's cheaper to buy. Try finding another brand-new dedicated plug-and-play server for $99. If you take energy costs into account that old PC in the closet isn't so cheap after all.
It doesn't slow down Dad's PC. You know how Dad hates that.
It boots straight into Minecraft. Your old PC won't do that.
It's easy to find. Every $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ has a unique name chosen by its owner (wildweasel.mineserver.com for example) and can be discovered by players you like (more on this below) from all over the Internet without ever using an IP address.
It's easy to administer. Most Minecraft servers use a Command Line Interface. How are your Linux sysadmin chops? Not so good, eh? So most home Minecraft servers aren't effectively administered at all. But our $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ comes with a tiny web server that allows the server to be monitored with a graphical interface from a parental PC or from our free iOS or Android phone apps. From the dairy aisle at the supermarket Mom can reboot the server or ban a specific player who she sees from the scrolling chat log is using bad language. She can even maintain a whitelist of accepted players with all others kept out.
And it's fast -- really fast!  You might not expect a $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ to keep up with big commercial servers but there is a huge advantage to operating on a local network as opposed to the broader Internet. If your Internet connection is rated at 5, 10, or 15 megabits-per-second, which is typical, that's how fast Minecraft can run. But our $99 Mineserver‰ã¢ lives on a gigabit Ethernet connection generally straight to your home router. That's 10-100 times faster than a commercial Minecraft server.
And our $199 Mineserver Pro‰ã¢ is even faster! We got a little carried away one day and built a Minecraft supercomputer for those who want even more performance. With twice as many cores and twice as much memory running at a clock speed that's a third faster than our $99 Mineserver‰ã¢, the $199 Mineserver Pro‰ã¢ could easily handle 100 players but we limit it to 50 players just to keep things running a bit cooler. It still costs only about $2 per year to run.
CHEAPER. EASIER. SAFER. FASTER. AND EVEN FASTER! 
A note about networking. We love Ethernet but to some folks it's a WiFi world so we have a $10 WiFi option for our $99 Mineservers‰ã¢ and WiFi is built in all our Mineserver Pros‰ã¢. Now let us talk you out of using it. WiFi (ours is 802.11n) is slower than gig-Ethernet and even if all your computers at home are connected by WiFi you probably don't need WiFi in your Mineserver‰ã¢ to reach them. That's because the best Mineserver‰ã¢ installation is plugged directly into an Ethernet port on your router or WiFi access point. Use THAT WiFi, not ours, because using ours introduces yet another WiFi roundtrip hop (router or access point to Mineserver‰ã¢ and back to router or access point) just slowing the whole thing down when running on a single radio. And don't even think of creating a standalone Minecraft WiFi network because the Minecraft clients have to be able to reach over the Internet Mojang's authorization servers in order to work at all. But if you really, really want WiFi, ORDER IT NOW because it can't be added later to your Mineserver‰ã¢‰ã¢. Sorry.  
Mineserver‰ã¢ is not endorsed by or affiliated with Mojang AB. Support not offered by Mojang AB. 
Update... Our Kickstarter project is a success. We have reached our goal and will be funded. A special thanks to all of our backers who pledged, encouraged, and believe in this product.

The advent of smartphones and tablets has made our information portable. We're often clenching onto our phones to ensure it doesn‰Ûªt slip away. It may be cumbersome to hold a device in our hand while browsing through social media, sports highlights, or checking email. How often have you tried to prop up your phone against a cereal box or milk carton, only to have it topple over? Is there a better way?
PLAY

I wanted to incorporate our devices with our lifestyle. It had to be something natural, useful; not something that would require any forethought. I‰Ûªve looked in the market for different ways to mount my phone, but nothing I found complement our smartphones' features. Products were clunky, second rate, and unremarkable. What is the alternative?
Handmade gently hammered ring in Sterling silver.
Rings have the power to reflect who we are; without a spoken word, and make us unique. Humans have been wearing rings for identity, status, and any other reason probably since the beginning of time. So imagine the millions of rings made each year to entice us. Why not make it serve a higher purpose?
‰ÛÏThe mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.‰Û ‰Û¥ Albert Einstein
Neoringså¨ uses the concept of magnetism to connect users with their devices. This attraction allows you the freedom of dexterity, while, still holding on the benefits of your smartphone. Thus, making this product distinctive in the high-tech driven market; empowering you to do more with less.
Patent pending Neoringså¨ consist of a powerful Neodymium magnet embedded into a stainless steel crown. The ring is made of the highest-grade stainless steel and is available in an array of color inlays; including a handmade ring made from sterling silver. The sizes range from kid size 3 to adult size 15 and would be the perfect gift for any occasion.
PLAY

We've field tested this prototype for months on smartphones and tablets and have found no adverse effects to device performance. Take it for a twirl and you'll understand the carefree feeling of knowing your phone is secure in your hand.
The Perfect Stand
Take it off. It serves as an ideal way to prop up your phone for the best viewing angle. Use it on long flights to watch a movie or while waiting at the doctor‰Ûªs office. This is not one more stand to carry around. You're already wearing it!
Neoringså¨ are fashionable, trendy, and can be a great addition to any wardrobe. The ring attaches to a steel backing called a Neodisk‰ã¢; which remains adhered to your smartphone or tablet. The Neodisk‰ã¢ is sleek and unobtrusive, going unnoticed in your pocket. It is cleverly designed to house an outer casing called Neotack‰ã¢.
Neotack‰ã¢
Neotack‰ã¢ is a button-like, magnetic, steel mount that serves as the mating end and receiver for the Neodisk‰ã¢. It utilizes the best quality 3M VHB adhesive that can be placed on nearly any surface. A Neotack‰ã¢ can be attached to your car console, boat, bike, or to the wall. It‰Ûªs not limited to just your smartphone or tablet!
Can you come up with even more creative ways to use a Neotack‰ã¢?

My Story
My experience is in machining.
I know metal, and I know metal fabrication. Reviewing prints, writing CNC programs, and working with these machines gave me the hands-on knowledge to take a product from the design stages to manufacturing. I work closely with my customers, product engineers, and quality assurance inspectors to ensure their parts are made correctly and on time.  
After spending years making others‰Ûª visions become a reality, I decided it was time to take my own dreams from the drawing board to the real world. Take a look.
PLAY

Manufacturing
Neoringså¨ is imagined, designed, tested, and produced here in Salt Lake City, Utah. We intend to continue making this product in the USA. We believe in quality above all else, and believe the best stuff comes from our own backyard. We possess the right team, blueprints, manufacturing capability, and the know how to mass produce Neoringså¨ for our backers.

Make the Pledge
Your pledge now will help us realize the dream of introducing a better way to keep our smartphones and devices with us. How many Neoringså¨ will the world need? Only you can help me find out.
I envision the Neoringså¨ brand becoming the most sought after method of holding onto our phones. Too long have we suffered with mediocre devices not befitting the elegance and style of our smartphones and tablets.

Welcome to the Kickstarter page for The Glitch! The Glitch is a simple to use, plug-and-play, security/pen-testing hardware platform. There are many great "Do It Yourself" (DIY) security auditing hardware projects out there. The problem for most people is the time and expertise it takes to construct and operate them. About a year ago I started work on one such DIY project.  I found many people interested in the project who just did not have the resources to build it on their own.  
My motivation for this project is to make open hardware security auditing more accessible to non-engineers. Developers can create project so that end users will not need to edit code or solder hardware to get them working. 
Help me produce an assembled run and be among the first to get your Glitch. Keep reading to see everything The Glitch can do!
Project Page: theglitch.sourceforge.net
Platform
The Glitch can be used to test a variety of technologies. While The Glitch comes stocked with a few tricks up its sleeve already, it will build upon a community of security researchers to expand its capabilities.
The Glitch is built on open source software inspired by the Arduino platform. If you want to develop/edit the firmware, you can. Or you can stick with the stock configuration. No need to learn any more about the hardware or software then you have time for. The ability to edit the code makes it possible for individuals to develop with The Glitch for their own projects.
Features:
Small size
Atmel 8-bit processor
USB connector
Micro SD Reader
DIP Switch
Solderless pinouts
Programmable LEDs
The Glitch hardware is controlled by an Atmel 8-bit processor. Connector cables allow you to connect additional hardware adapters without the need to solder. It has a small USB port on the front, which can be used with common USB adapters to connect to a PC.  The Glitch can be programed or launch modules through the USB interface.
The Glitch has a built in MicroSD reader for convenient data storage and configuration on a MicroSD card. Users can configure their own modules to control the actions of The Glitch. Modules are selectable on-the-fly using the DIP switch on the bottom. All the resources for the modules are stored in directories on the MicroSD card. For example, the contents of the mod05 directory on the MicroSD card would control what is launched when Module 5 is selected. Using self contained modules allow users to bundle up and share their payloads with one another.
Projects
The Glitch is capable of expanding to many different projects. The following projects are currently available capabilities of The Glitch.
Keyboard Emulation
Out of the box, The Glitch is capable of performing keyboard emulation. Users can configure a keystroke injection module to browse to a specific website, download and install an app, change system configuration, or anything else you can do with a keyboard (which is a lot!). Once plugged into the USB port, The Glitch will launch the user defined module by typing thousands of keys a minute flawlessly.
Keystroke Logging
A keylogging adapter allows The Glitch to log keystrokes onto the Micro SD card. Keystrokes are logged in a format that can later be replayed through keyboard emulation. The logging adapter is an additional piece of hardware which connects to The Glitch. 
Embedding
Another key feature of The Glitch is that it is small enough to be embedded in computer peripherals, like a computer mouse. Along with a small USB hub, the Glitch can be placed into all kinds of electronics without interfering with their operation. When the cover is placed back on the mouse in the picture, it works exactly as it did before (with a little bonus). The form factor of The Glitch will be even smaller then the prototypes in the pictures.
Bluetooth Control
The Glitch can be controlled through Bluetooth with an adapter. Projects can leverage input and output through Serial over Bluetooth using a Bluetooth RS232 hardware adapter. The Serial connection can be used as an alternative to the DIP switch to select a module. Data can also be transmitted back through the Serial connection from The Glitch.
Additional Projects
Developer can use The Glitch for a number of projects. Existing projects can be ported over to The Glitch from other Arduino platforms.  See the project page at http://theglitch.sf.net for information on expanding projects, including RFID.
Making Things Easier on the User
Instead of requiring users to compile and edit code on their own, developers for The Glitch can provide a per-compiled HEX file (firmware) of their projects. This is similar to developers providing an application rather then just the source code. Users can flash The Glitch with the firmware and hit the ground running.
Firmware can be written to accept user input from the DIP switch and Micro SD card, so it is not necessary to write or edit code. The DIP switch allows dynamic input from the user which corresponds with a module on the Micro SD card. These modules consist of a configuration file (plain text or otherwise) interpreted by the firmware to perform a specific task and (potentially) other files, like a payload. Modules are configured by the user ahead of time on the Micro SD card to perform specific tasks based on which firmware is running on The Glitch.
For example, a Keystroke Injection module would contain a configuration file and a payload. The configuration file tells the firmware that the payload is a Batch script that will run on a Windows computer. The firmware interprets the configuration and performs all the tasks necessary to read in the Batch script from the Micro SD card, type it out on the target system, run and delete the script. Other projects can be written to follow user defined configuration in a similar manner.
Promoting The Project
If you like this project, help promote it!  You can direct people to this page or to the SourceForge project page http://theglitch.sf.net.
The project is also trending on Twitter as #maketheglitch
Building The Glitch
All PCBs for prototyping are done through a US open hardware group.  Prototypes are assembled in the workshop in NC.  The final run of The Glitch will be built by a professional manufacturing firm, where the hardware will be assembled and tested.

NOTE: The Glitch does not come with a case unless specifically stated in the Reward.
As we store more and more personal information in smartphones, there is an ever-growing need to keep this data private and protected. EndlessID (EID), a suite based on patent-pending security and privacy features, has created a line of products and features that can help protect all kinds of data stored on mobile devices.
 "A tool that keeps your jealous boyfriend from reading your text messages or seeing if you‰Ûªve been swiping right on Tinder."
All EndlessID products contain a chip that functions as an ID, which identifies you as a person and recognizes your account. That ID can only be read or recorded by our apps or our SDK / APIs and will not be accessible by anyone else. Rest assure it has strict security measures. In itself, within our devices, no type of information is stored, instead your information will be accessed through the ID that is in your EID device. This allows our devices to maintain all your information secure at all times. You do not need to worry in the case that you were to misplace your EID product or have it stolen. It will not be a problem since you can lock the device and your EndlessID product making it impossible to access the information.
EndlessID was developed with a unique patent-pending system that is very easy to use. In order for you to enjoy all the EndlessID benefits you must‰Û_
As you can see below, all of our EndlessID devices are characterized by elegant, modern and durable designs. Our goal is to not only create an indispensable product for your life, but also a product that you enjoy using. All of our products are water resistant and do not need to be charged, ever!

Unlock your door with EndlessID
Did you know you can open doors with EndlessID? We have received questions asking if EndlessID can be used to open door locks with integrated NFC and the answer is YES! Our EID decives can be programmed as electronic keys for locks with NFC. Watch this video demonstration of how it works ( Samsung Digital Door Lock SHS-1321 )
The EndlessID App was created to be as functional and simple as possible. You will activate all of our products with the EID application.  With the EID App you can make the most out of all the possibilities our products offer.
Below is a list of the features that EID would provide in the launch version, but of course we will continue working to provide even more possibilities every day.
* All of these options will be available in both our mobile app and our web version.
As we said before, our main objective is to make life simpler for everyone. Our team has worked very hard in order to put the best solution in the hands of our users. We have developed many prototypes, tests and designs, and we believe we have reached a product of high quality and one that provides the best user experience possible.
Our entire team has worked tirelessly to get to this point and we are ready to make this dream happen. We believe a simpler better life with the use of technology at an affordable price is an attainable dream.
Designing EndlessID
Prototypes
Right now we are at the most important stage of our development. We are finalizing our working prototypes and closing in on the final objective ‰ÛÓputting in the hands of our users an excellent product that will change their lives for the better. On the other hand, we are also in full throttle with the development of our app for both mobile and web.
Funds Breakdown:
We want to be transparent on how we spend the funds from our supporters. Here is a projection of how the funds will be spent:
As we are convinced that big changes require the support of working together, we have designed an SDK and APIs, totally free so that any developer who shares our dreams can implement EID on their existing products or create their own ideas supported by our products. We believe the key to doing something amazing is teamwork.

1.Our Mission: To liberate IT and Cyber Security training so that it becomes and remains free and accessible to everyone, everywhere, of every skill level, forever. 
We believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn for free, and the role we can play in making that belief a reality, is to provide free IT and Cyber Security training. 
It has become nearly impossible for many people to pursue their passion of learning about technology and cyber security because of the outrageous costs and lack of availability.  We have built the framework for anyone to pursue this dream and we did so because everyone deserves, at very least, the opportunity. What they do with the opportunity is up to them, but education should be a right for all people globally.
2. What we plan to accomplish and provide to the world: We plan to continually evolve and expand our list of classes and resources that are available to the public. In doing so, we will further develop the online IT and Cyber Security learning model, to make it more full and comprehensive.
3. We want to include features such as: Transcriptions / captioning for all of the videos for the hearing impaired, a mobile app so that people do not necessarily have to stream the learning content, and more interactive learning tools and exercises like quizzes and other ways of testing comprehension. We also need to expand the list of classes overall.
4. Cybrary‰Ûªs Goal: In order for Cybrary to sustain our model of providing free IT and Cyber Security classes to everyone, everywhere, forever, we must reach a critical mass of students, which is approximately 250,000. We are also looking to add some key features that further facilitate learning for people in developing nations (due to poor internet reliability), such as a hybrid mobile app so that the videos do not need to be streamed. In order to reach that sustainable point and add these features, we need approximately $200,000. However, $25,000 would at least allow us to create the mobile app and add a few more resources / classes.
Buddhist Geeks Conference 2012 - Boulder, CO | August 9 - 11th
UPDATE #1:  Conference Venue: The University Memorial Center
UPDATE #2:  Stephen Batchelor Confirmed as Keynote Speaker

‰ÛÏEveryone at Buddhist Geeks have opened a door to a different kind of conversation about Buddhism in the West.‰Û - Ken McLeod

Following the success of the inaugural Buddhist Geeks | The Conference this summer, this is an opportunity for you to help take the event to the next level as well as reserve your spot at The Buddhist Geeks Conference 2012!
We're keeping attendance limited in 2012, so that we can maintain the sense of intimacy and close-knit community that made this year's event so special.  As a result, we anticipate that tickets will go quickly, so this is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor and enjoy a big discount.  And even if you can‰Ûªt attend in person, your support will also be incredibly valuable in making it happen, and then sharing the media and learning from the event with the wider world. 
Not Your Normal Buddhist Conference

‰ÛÏIt's clear that the electronic virtual interconnected web and online world is the wild way the Dharma stream is flowing, and the Geeks have their minds dialed into the revolutionary next generation.‰Û - Jack Kornfield

While planning the first Conference which took place in Los Angeles in July 2011, we recognized that some Buddhist events can be boring, predictable, and tend to draw on the same group of speakers, again and again.  Instead, we wanted to curate an event which had a completely fresh and innovative format, in which we could explore new topics with enthusiasm.  And it worked.  And we knew it worked because participants left thrilled and exhilarated with feedback saying:

"The inaugural conference had incredible energy: the energy of potent potential. It's like being a kid: your whole life is still ahead of you." 

"After spending over 35 years in the business world and often attending various conferences, I'd say the Buddhist Geeks Conference was once of best I've ever attended as far as flow, organization, welcoming feeling, motivation, etc." 

"Stunned, floored, amazed by how wonderful it was especially for a first-time event." 
And not only that but the event ended up being featured by several major newspapers and magazines, including:
This is clearly a different kind of event to most Buddhist conferences.
Next year‰Ûªs event will build on everything we learned this year, while adding some exciting new elements.  There will be keynote speakers, mini-presentations, musical and artistic performances, time to practice together, and plenty of opportunity to get to know fellow conference goers.  In many ways it's the people that make this such a wonderful opportunity.  And this will all happen, nestled at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, in beautiful Boulder, Colorado. 
What We're Using the Money For
Many don't know that last year‰Ûªs conference was completely self-funded.  We raised all the money for the conference as we went along!  We had no idea if we would make it work, or even if Buddhist Geeks would survive the process.  If it weren‰Ûªt for our most dedicated community members, and the generosity of many organizations and people who helped us make this happen, we wouldn‰Ûªt have been able to pull it of.  But fortunately we did, and we were able to break even financially last year.  The risk was definitely worth the payoff! 
This year we are committed to improving on last year, and in order to do that we need to be able to have a more robust conference budget, having access to the needed up-front funds to make it happen.  The shoestring approach worked once, but it's definitely not a sustainable strategy! 
Some of the biggest costs in putting on a conference of this size include the cost of the conference venue (wireless internet is a must!), the costs associated with presenter travel, lodging, and payment, and all the technological, material, and logistical costs (we were surprised to see how these things could add up).  In total, a conference like this costs between $50,000 - $75,000 to put on. 
So in this Kickstarter campaign we need at least $20,000 in this campaign in order to make sure we can sustainably handle the upfront costs of organizing next year‰Ûªs event, making Buddhist Geeks Conference 2012 a reality.  Anything above that will go a huge way in helping mitigate the financial risks that we‰Ûªre taking as an organization, and allow us to make this a yearly event that is well attended and can help move forward a very important conversation about the development of Buddhist practice in the modern world.  We think it‰Ûªs well worth the risk, and are happy to put everything on the line to make it happen.  Please join us in investing in this incredibly important conversation.  We couldn't do it without you. 
48 Hour Update:
The t65 Air Clip: Final Design.
After countless design tweaks and improvements we finally have the t65 Air Clip‰Ûªs finished design in production. The new model is about half the material of our original concept, without compromising the security of your iPad Air. The t65 will feature a å_-20 thread to allow you to connect your iPad Air to any mount your heart desires (music stand, on the fly teleprompter, you name it)! If you‰Ûªd rather hold it in your hand, no problem, this custom clip will feature an adjustable elastic hand strap, perfect for taking orders at a restaurant or playing air hockey with your iPad Air (don‰Ûªt do that). Best of all, it‰Ûªs an exact fit for your iPad Air and Original Padcaster.

Stretch Goal! $30,000 : iPhone Adapter for the Mini Padcaster
The t65 has inspired us. With the last 48 hours of our campaign fast approaching, we‰Ûªve decided to make a final push for an iPhone adapter for the iPad mini. Throughout the campaign many of you have expressed interest in making the Padcaster accessible to iPhones. We love the idea and after seeing the final results of the t65 we are confident we can make another awesome product that will bring iPhones into The Padcaster Family. If we can reach $30,000 before the campaign ends at 1:19pm Thursday we will put our overflow funding towards getting an adapter for your iPhone into production and up for sale!
Weekly Updates:
Every Monday: A weekly update! - We will notify all of our backers of our progress in an update every Monday. This will include current funding status, a countdown to the end of the campaign, any updates, general Padcaster news, etc.
Every Wednesday: Livestreamin' Wednesdays! - Every Wednesday @ 1PM Josh will be giving suggestions, advice, and will answer any and all Padcaster questions you throw his way!

Every Friday: Video Fun! - Every Friday, in the late afternoon, we will be posting a video made by The Padcaster Team specially designed for your viewing pleasure! Next up Feb. 28th, our final Kickstarter video!
Recent News!
The Padcaster Adds Its "Verse" to Apple's Latest Campaign.
We couldn't be more excited to have The Padcaster featured - among a number of other inventive uses for the iPad - in the inspiring "Your Verse" iPad Air commercial and campaign from Apple. It's a great testament to what we have been talking about for the past few years: there are no limits to what can be created with the iPad, as long as you have a great idea and the right tools. You might notice in our project video the footage Josh shot of the beautiful Iguazu Falls with The Padcaster and iPad Air. The best news of all? You don't need to travel to Argentina to capture amazing footage like this - all you need is The Padcaster!
What is the Padcaster Mini?
Based on the same design as our Original Padcaster, The Padcaster Mini features a sturdy aluminum frame with a flexible insert, tailor-fit for the iPad mini. The iPad mini offers the same impressive 1080p HD video recording as the iPad Air in a lighter, more compact package. It's the perfect Padcaster companion and natural next step in production. 
The aluminum frame is lined with 1/4-20 and 3/8-16 threaded holes for attaching lights, mics and other camera gear. Great for handheld video, the Padcaster Mini also has a special bottom thread and locking pin hole that allows you to mount it to a professional monopod or tripod.
The secure and flexible insert lets you easily pop your iPad mini into the Padcaster - a snug fit for protection, confidence and steady on-the-go shooting. 
Included with every Padcaster Mini are two cold shoe adapters for your favorite lights or mics, a lens bracket with both 72mm and 58mm threads for your choice of wide angle or telephoto adapters, four hand-tightening screws to attach the lens bracket and even a custom camera mount screw to use the Padcaster Mini frame as a standalone DSLR cage!
Now you can shoot, edit and distribute your HD video right from the iPad mini, making it ideal for video blogging, journalism, Livestreaming and much more.
What Makes The Padcaster Different from the other iPad Videography Cases Out There?
Though the original inspiration and intended use for the Padcaster was as a piece of videography equipment, its versatile design has inspired our customers to use it in a variety of ways we never even imagined.
We've seen our product used as a teleprompter and as a cage for a DSLR. We've seen it tricked out with LED lights, and hooked up to watch television in bed, as well as in the backseat of a car. We've even seen it used by Kelly Croy of Wired Educator as a tool to help disabled children in the classroom.
Stony Brook University‰Ûªs School of Journalism used The Padcaster to film their first ever live broadcast! They later joined us at the 2013 CWW Expo and were led by their technical manager Phil Altiere in producing a mini news show for the CCW audience using the same technology as they did for The Wolfstock Live Broadcast.
Over this last year, we've been amazed to see not only the possibilities of The Padcaster, but also the inventiveness of the people who use it. We can't help but think that the Padcaster for the iPad mini will inspire more creativity!

Padcaster as an on-the-fly LED
Why We Need Your Help:
The Original Padcaster and Padcaster Air - a sleek insert that makes the Original compatible with the iPad Air - are already in production, having been funded almost entirely out of pocket by the Padcaster team. But interest has increased in the past few months and we need help in order to meet the demands of our audience. During the last year, we've been asked repeatedly when we will have a Padcaster for the iPad mini. 
With our limited resources and the recent release of the Padcaster Air Kit, it would be impossible to continue production of the Original Padcaster and the Air Kit while simultaneously researching and developing a Padcaster for the iPad mini. This is why we need your help!
With this campaign we hope to successfully manufacture a Padcaster for the iPad Mini. This will provide a wider range of iPad owners the opportunity to take advantage of the all-in-one production studio experience.
If we can surpass our goal of $15K, we'd love to put the additional funds towards bringing production to the States. We‰Ûªve researched local companies and realize production costs are significantly higher, but we‰Ûªre confident that with your help, we can make this stretch goal a reality.

"I discovered a unique educational function for the device while consulting with educators wanting to equip a multiple handicap student with an iPad...It allows her to see the device better, holds it for her safely, and has offered her the ability to use the iPad more independently than any other method we could find. The Padcaster truly helped this child. In our use, the iPad can be removed easily and quickly and reinserted with little effort. The device is safe and can be positioned [anywhere] needed. We are incredibly impressed. We hope more educators find uses for this device for physically challenged students."
Production & Fulfillment Plan:
We feel confident that our knowledge gained through the production process of the Original Padcaster will allow us to effectively and efficiently produce the Padcaster Mini. We've gone through the process already so we've made our rookie mistakes and know our way around the manufacturing process.
We have a manufacturer all set to go and a quote for tooling costs. The drawings are done so all that's left to do is submit them to the manufacturer for approval, look at what they build, approve it, and go. It's really just the price tag that's the issue. 
For those of you who don't already know, this is our second Kickstarter attempt for the Padcaster Mini. Although the campaigns are similar and presenting the exact same product, you may have noticed one large difference: our funding goal is much lower this time. The reason for this discrepancy is that our previous Kickstarter campaign accounted for another production of the Original Padcaster, research and development of the Air Adapter, as well as production of the Mini.
This time we are focusing all of our funding on the Mini, having taken care of the other costs on our own.The Padcaster Mini is our company's main priority right now and we want that to be reflected in our campaign.

Background on Printing and Mobile Printing:
Over the last 30 years, printers have advanced drastically from black and white, poor quality, slow devices to high quality color devices with significant speed. However, what has not progressed is the need to install a printer driver in order to connect to the printer. When Smartphones were first introduced, there was no way to print from a mobile device. In fact, on some mobile devices a print command did not even exist. As people found more uses for their smartphones and tablets, the need to print became more and more essential.
Why You Need printWiFi & printUSB....
Since users take mobile devices with them wherever they go ‰ÛÒ they need to print ‰ÛÏWherever They Are‰Û.
It is expected that 75% of Smart Mobile Device Users will want to print from their mobile devices.* If the mobile device is not compatible with the existing local printer they can't print!
This is further complicated by the need to have access of the WiFi network to which a compatible printer is connected. Mobile device users ‰ÛÏOn-the-Go‰Û  may not be able to access the WiFi network at their destinations. Thus, it is unlikely to find a compatible printer on an accessible WiFi network.
Students often can't print from their new tablets to existing classroom printers or printers at home.
The Problem with the Current Mobile Printing Solutions:    
"They Aren‰Ûªt Mobile!‰Û
As a result, mobile devices are usually unable to print directly to printers. Documents, often confidential, must be emailed to a other people and have them print from their PC. If mobile users cannot share information with others, due to security reasons or don‰Ûªt have email capability... they can‰Ûªt print.
ImageTech's Mobile Printing Solutions:
ImageTech's development of patent pending technology has resulted in two innovative and effective products, printWiFi‰ã¢ & printUSB‰ã¢.  Small Mobile Printer Controllers which allow Smartphones and Tablets to securely and accurately print direct to existing printers. printWiFi & printUSB connect to an existing local printer via a USB connection. Most printers have USB interfaces on the back of the printer in addition to Ethernet or other network connections.
printWiFi provides a Hot Spot for Mobile Device printing: allowing up to 30 mobile devices to connect directly to printWiFi via its own WiFi signal.
People who don't need a WiFi connection from the mobile device may purchase the printUSB which, uses its USB connections for both the printer and mobile device. The phone's or tablet's USB Data/Charging cable is used to connect to the printUSB.
Technical Details
printWiFi and printUSB printer controllers are small compact devices with  rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, at 2 by 4 inches and only weighing 24 ounces, can easily fit in a briefcase, purse or pocket. printWiFi and printUSB support over 5,000 different printer models (see complete list at http://www.imagetechcorp.com/support.html). printWiFi provides an 802.11n WiFi access point allowing up to thirty simultaneous mobile devices to printer connections. Both printWiFi and printUSB have one USB-A connector for a mobile device, one USB-A connector for a printer and one Micro-USB connector for charging. The Micro-USB connector also allows a PC to use the printer connected to a printWiFi or printUSB. This is a typical configuration used in a home office or small business. printWiFi and printUSB ship with a USB Printer Cable and a Micro-USB Charging Cable.
A free printing App named printView will be downloadable from the Apple App or Google Play Stores. The printView App for the Smartphone and Tablet markets will initially support iPhone, iPad running iOS 7 or higher as well as Android Tablet and Phones running 2.3 or higher.
Apps for Windows Mobile, Surface and Surface Pro operating systems are also planned. printView allows for importing of documents from other Apps, email, camera roll, Dropbox and other Internet storage locations. printView allows for accurate document rendering (including Microsoft Office fonts, formats, headers/footers and pagination) before printing. printView can print to AirPrint printers as well as printers upgraded to support mobile printing by printWiFi or printUSB.

Our mobile phones and devices connect us to the world in ever expanding ways. We call home, text friends, surf the web, listen to music, read books, watch movies, take photos, shoot video, play games, and even order pizza and an Uber, all with a few clicks and swipes. These devices are so versatile and valuable that we often keep them close at hand, if not right in hand. Yet, with screen sizes growing larger and phones getting thinner, we are finding them more and more challenging to comfortably and securely hold. While cases aim to protect against damage after a drop, they really don‰Ûªt solve the problem of preventing a drop, nor do they adequately address the issue of comfortably holding a device. That got us thinking‰Û_
Mobile devices connect people to the world, but is there a better way to connect people to their mobile devices?
We founded Bullz-i Inc. to engineer an elegant and universal solution to this simple question. Our product, THE RiNG, is a slim, round aluminum attachment that adheres to the back of your phone, device, or case. It is lightweight and unassumingly simple in appearance, yet incredibly sturdy, stylish, and powerful in function.  
THE RiNG brings confidence, comfort, and style to your mobile device experience.
Confidence
Using THE RiNG, you can be confident that your mobile device is securely in hand. Now you can USE your phone instead of worrying about how to HOLD your phone. 
Comfort
THE RiNG is rounded and smooth to the touch. It easily fits most fingers, and reduces the strain associated with gripping your phone or device.  
Style
THE RiNG is hard anodized aluminum with a thin profile that complements the design of your phone or device. It looks and feels like it was meant to be there from the start. 
360 Degree Rotation
THE RiNG is a set of concentric rings, hence our company name, Bullz-i. The outer ring/base attaches to the phone or device.  The inner ring folds up and rotates a full 360 degrees so you can effortlessly change the position of your phone or device, all while never having to remove your finger from THE RiNG.  
Strong But Removable Adhesive 
THE RiNG attaches to phones, devices, and cases with a 3M adhesive that performs as though it were permanent, yet allows for removal as well. To remove, slide a credit card underneath THE RiNG while pulling up and work across the bottom. The remaining adhesive can be removed by simply pulling the adhesive film off THE RiNG, leaving no lasting glue on either THE RiNG or your device. We include an extra adhesive so you can reattach as needed.  See the video below for a complete demonstration of applying and removing THE RiNG.
Slim Design 
THE RiNG is very slim at 3.5mm, which is roughly å_ the height or less of a typical mobile phone. When not in use, the inner ring folds down allowing you to easily slide your phone or device in and out of your pocket or to simply lay it flat on a table.
Why aluminum? 
Aluminum is light and strong. It complements the style of mobile devices, resists corrosion, and allows for color anodizing and laser etching as we expand our design offerings in the future. Aluminum is 100% recyclable.
Yup, It Works as a Stand Too
Interview with Co-Founder Eric Due
Our Partners
We are fortunate to be working with a tremendously talented team of partners through both the creation of Bullz-i Inc. and the development and introduction of THE RiNG. Focus Product Design has guided our design from our prototype to market-ready product. Damien Shulock has been a great influence in the design process and our engineering force. Steve Barretto and his team of marketing gnomes at Barretto-Co. have been instrumental in developing our brand and message.  John Emmons has helped guide us through sales and strategy. GTC Law took us from three friends with a dream to a full-fledged corporation. GM Nameplate and 3M have helped in refining and coordinating our adhesive application. Lahlouh is coordinating our packaging and shipping. Last but not least, Kickstarter is helping us introduce THE RiNG to all of you!
Prototyping
With something so personal, we were aware we needed a physical prototype to accurately share our vision. The design process started with crude foam core and cardboard prototypes. These gave great concrete answers to some vital early questions. Would this be functional? Would the profile be too thick? Will it be useful closed? Will it be comfortable?
We found a local machinist in San Francisco who was able to work through the initial development stages and create a fully functional prototype.  It was only one ring, but we knew we had something right away.
We began showing the ring to family and friends and the response we got reinforced our enthusiasm to move forward.
We plowed through incorporation docs, product design, patent filings, marketing vision, manufacturing sourcing, packaging, distribution, sales and strategy. 
Our manufacturer has already started making THE RiNG. Yup, you heard that right. The manufacturing process is underway and we expect delivery shortly after the end of our 30 day Kickstarter campaign. You, our supporters, will be the first to have THE RiNG. Kickstarter is the perfect forum to announce THE RiNG to our friends, family and early adopters. Your enthusiastic interest and support will serve to announce THE RiNG has arrived! We are already pursuing THE RiNG with different colors and co-branded logo options (think sports teams etc.) for future options.
Thank you,
Eric, Geoff, George
Stretch Goals Added! Please see update for information.
BeagleBone Black Version Stretch Goal Reached!
We decided to go all in and added a Quad Core 1.7ghz Odroid3 option without bothering with the final stretch goal!
What is YaCyPi:
YaCyPi will be a turnkey solution for the Raspberry Pi with the goal of turning a common ordinary Raspberry Pi (Model B) into your very own search engine. Using the software YaCy, you no longer need to be bound by Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc for your internet queries.
We believe that society benefits from free access to information. In order for this to be possible information needs to be freely accessible by everyone. Currently the domain of search is controlled by corporations who have the ability to manipulate results.
When Google was first designed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, they made the following claim: "But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm." [ Citation: Appendix A  ]
Sadly, today search engines are dominated by corporate and government interests. Between free information and the user, a vital link is missing: free search.
YaCy aims to correct this problem. YaCy is the missing link between free content and the search-engine independent user. Only a decentralized search engine technology can ensure free access to knowledge. YaCyPi is and will always be released under GPL.
What is YaCy:
YaCy is a software stack that allows for free internet searches through a decentralized network.  YaCy claims to be, "Web Search by the people, for the people." 
YaCy Explained - Image Property of yacy.de - used under GPL
Why would I want this:
There are several reasons you may want a system like this. First and foremost would be to limit the amount of tracking that is done on you by the major search engines. Every time you search on google, your search is saved, over time this helps google build up a profile of you. Aside from not desiring to be tracked by companies which trade and sell your software, the NSA Leaks by Edward Snowden have shown how information from the major search engines are captured and analyzed by governments around the world.  
Even if you are doing nothing wrong, there is no reason you should be spied on every time you use a search engine.The problem with profiling online searches is that the context of those searches is unknown. So looking at these searches without context, can result in a improper profile.I highly recommend taking a few minutes to watch a few minutes of the following clip from Aleks Krotoski's documentary, "The Virtual Revolution: The Cost of Free"  (watch up to at least 50:25)
Second there is the benefit that since YaCy is based on a decentralized network, there is no way for anyone to censor internet sites. A decentralized search system gives users freedom and independence.
How will it work:
This will be a complete turnkey solution. All you will need to do is plug in the SD card, plug your Raspberry Pi into the network, connect power and boot. Once the Raspberry Pi boots, put its IP address on your local network into your browser and you're ready to go. All of the pre configuration will be done for you. You are more than welcome to go in and change any settings later if you'd like. You will also be able to set a Static IP for your device on your local network if you choose.Since this is a solution for the Raspberry Pi, you are free to take this with you when you travel, or are at a friends house and still wish your searches to be private.
Current project status:
Building on past development experience, the base Raspberry Pi image will be a Puppy Linux ARM released utilizing the Debian Wheezy Armel repo.  The choice of using Puppy Linux over the stock Raspbian was made due to not needing a full X environment, and wanting to use the least amount of system resources as possible.  Since YaCyPi will run 'headless', that is with no graphical system; there is no reason for the OS to waste resources on running this code.  This will give the maximum amount of system resources to the YaCy code stack.  Since the Raspberry Pi's hardware resources are minimal, this will allow much better performance over a stock Rasbian image. 
Base Image - Raspberry Pi Resource Usage
Project Timeline:
Currently the Core Raspberry Pi image is almost complete.  Further refinement needs to take place for maximum efficiency.  Once the core image is fine tuned, integration of the YaCy Software Stack will begin, along with all configuration so that a user is required to do no configuration before being able to search the web through the distributed peer-to-peer network.
Once completed, all a user will be required to do is insert the SD card, plug their Raspberry Pi into their network, and power up the device. (Depending on your local network, you may additionally need to forward port 8090 to your Raspberry Pi on your router)
Final refinement of the Core Image as well as the most efficient configuration of the YaCy Software Stack will be completed in two months.  
Shipping of Supporter Reward levels will begin the week following completion of the OS and software.  Estimated shipping date will be late April of 2014.
Who we are:
We are a group of Security Consultants that are that are highly interested in restoring privacy online.  Obsidian Security Services has been providing Security Consulting since the late 90's. We specialize in providing boutique security consulting to our clients. Our areas of focus include Computer Security, Counter Surveillance, and Counter Forensic Solutions. We are also active Linux Developers with the Puppy Linux Project and active in the Fedora and Arch Linux Communities.  
Our Lead developer has personally developed four distinct Puppy Linux releases in the past. Two of which are designed for the Raspberry Pi.
AttackPup is the first Puppy Linux Pen-Testing focused release.
Slackbones is a minimal 64bit Puppy Linux release.
Raspberry Pi Random Pup is a single use release which enables a user to turn their Raspberry Pi into a Network Hardware Random Number Generator, enabling all machines on a network a source of true randomness.
Cloudpup is a release for the Raspberry Pi which allows a user to run a headless local instance of OwnCloud on their private network.
With the revelations from the Summer of Snowden, we have been focused more in finding ways to restore privacy online. We hope this project will help in that goal.
Disclaimer:
The YaCy network is made up of individuals who have chosen to help in the effort for a free and open search engine. As such the network does not run on hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware like Google and Bing.  As a result, searches are usually a bit slower.  I've found searching to take several seconds longer than if I was searching on Google.  As more users join the network, the network will operate faster.  Until YaCyPi has run for a while, search results will be minimal, until it fully connects to the entire YaCy network.  Again, this is a result of not having the resources of Google crawling the web. More users crawling the web = better search results.  The quality of the network hinges entirely on the numbers of people willing to help it. The YaCy network is growing, and it will continue to grow over time.  Do not expect this to be an instant replacement for Google  This is however a big step towards the future of a free and open internet.

Compliance & Security
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) became law under President Bill Clinton in 1996. This law, which ensures the portability/continuity of healthcare coverage for individuals changing jobs, also includes provisions that impact the management of heath information, simplify the administration of health insurance, and combat waste, fraud and abuse in the health-related industries.
 Key implications of HIPAA include:
Requirement of healthcare organizations to completely rethink the manner in which they protect the security and privacy of their patients‰Ûª/consumers‰Ûª health information
Mandated standard formats for the most common transactions between healthcare organizations
Need for many healthcare organizations to replace or substantially change their current systems and processes
To learn more about HIPAA compliance, please visit http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/.
Privacy and Security Platform
Imagine sending your health data through the postal system in a clear envelope. Anyone with access to the envelope can see the data. If it looks valuable, they might take it or change it. Our true 128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Certificate, the strongest available, establishes a private communications channel enabling encryption/scrambling of the data during transmission, essentially creating an opaque envelope for message privacy.
Where we stand at the moment
Prior to what we expect to be a kickass Kickstarter campaign, LinkedMD‰ã¢ is, at the moment, a desktop-based application requiring the use of Internet Explorer.
Once we are successful in raising the needed funding, LinkedMD‰ã¢ will quickly also become available as a portable app for platforms such as smartphones and tablets.
LinkedMD‰ã¢ can store and aggregate website login credentials for an unlimited number of medical facilities, pharmacies, lab facilities, insurance companies, etc., along with the ability to capture and store your information from the screens of those sites.

What Can a Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Cable or Adapter Do?
Quite a few amazing things:
Charge your smartphone (iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones, Windows phones, ...) 2-times as fast (most phones) and even 3-times as fast (some phones).
Turn your computer's USB port into (nearly) full-speed charger for tablets: iPad, Android tablets, Windows tablets.
Turn some slow-charging USB chargers into fast-charging ones, iPad-incompatible ones into iPad compatible, iPad-only chargers into universal chargers.
It blocks data transfer, so bad guys won't be able to steal data from your phone/tablet or hack it if when is connected to a compromised computer or charger.
Fast-charge cable can charge 2x as fast.
In addition to that, our fast-charge cable:
Has a switch that you can toggle between secure fast-charge mode and data-sync mode (at normal charging speed) -- so you can still use it for data transfer when needed.
Is a tangle-free extra tough cable with braided outer sleeve made of super durable and water resistant nylon fabric.
The Annoyances of USB Charging
We designed our Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Cable/Adapter to address a number of daily annoyances with USB charging:
Most computers' USB ports can only charge smartphones slowly -- at 0.5 Amp max. Charge current, measured in Amp, indicates how fast it charges; e.g., 1.0 Amp means charging twice as fast as 0.5 Amp.
Worse yet, most computers' USB ports can't charge iPad or other tablets because they require higher charge current (1.0 Amp or higher). Some can still be charged, but very slowly.
Compatibility issues: USB chargers from different vendors often don't play nice with each other. A few examples: (1) the official iPad charger can't charge Samsung Galaxy tablets and some other tablets; (2) the official Samsung Galaxy tablet charger can't charge iPad; (3) some after-market chargers can charge one type of devices (iPad or Android tablet) at high speed (2 Amp or higher) but they charge the other type of devices at much reduced speed.
Many after-market chargers don't charge your phone or iPad/tablet as fast as they claim: many may claim they can charge at 1 Amp for phones and 2 Amp for iPad and other tablets, but the actual charging speed may be just half of that. That include some the so-called Smart or Universal chargers that are supposed to be cable to charge both iPad and other tablets at 2 Amp or higher.
Hacker attack! If you use a regular USB cable to connect your smartphones to a computer that has been compromised by a hacker, it is possible for the hacker to steal data off your phone; or worse, compromise your phone. It has been found that, it is even possible to hide a hacking device inside a normal-looking charger that is capable of stealing data from your phone or compromising it. Be careful when connecting your phone/tablet to a public computer or charger.
Introducing Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Cable and Adapter
Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Cable
There are 2 versions of Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Cable: one with Lightning plug for Apple iPhone/iPad/iPod with lightning port, one with MicroUSB plug for Android, Windows and other types of devices with MicroUSB charging port.
Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Cable
It can charge phones much faster:
Charge Samsung Galaxy S5 more than 3x as fast
Your computer's USB port can charge iPad at 2 Amp using our Fast-Charge cable:
In addition to the fast-charging capability, a "smart" chip is embedded into our cable (see pictures in Peek Inside) that can "intelligently" differentiate different devices (iPad, Samsung Galaxy tablets etc.) and apply different signals to "trick" a charger to supply the highest proper charging current to the device being charged. The following picture shows that an iPad incompatible charger can now charge iPad at 2 Amp:
This solves a lot of (in)compatibility issues and turns nearly any charger into a universal high-speed charger. For example, using our Fast-Charge Cable with MicroUSB plug, you can charge all Android and Windows tablets including Samsung Galaxy tablets with the official Apple iPad charger -- you can't do that for many devices using regular USB cables. Similarly, you can use the official Samsung Galaxy tablet charger and other after-market chargers to charge an iPad. 
The cable has a built-in switch that let you toggle between secure fast-charge mode and data-sync normal-charge mode. We have designed a patent-pending circuit that allows in-flight switch of the 2 modes -- i.e., you can switch mode while the cable is connected and device is being charged without needing to plug/unplug the cable to change mode.
Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Adapter
Most people have many normal USB cables lying around already. So we also designed the Smart & Secure Fast-Charge Adapter to use with those cables. It provides all the amazing features of the cable: fast-charging, smart charging to turn most chargers into universal high-speed chargers, blocking data-sync to be secure. Except it doesn't have a switch -- to use your cable for normal data-sync function, just unplug the adapter. It is compatible with all standard MicroUSB cables and Lightning cables.

MFi Certification & Apple Compatibility
Our Fast-Charge Cable with Lightning plug will be MFi (Made-For-iPhone) certified -- that means it will use the official Apple Lightning connector and pass Apple's certification tests. We have consulted with an MFi certification testing lab and sent prototypes to them for testing. Based on their evaluation, there should be no problem with the certification application and tests. With official MFi certification, our Fast-Charge Cable will be guaranteed to be compatible with all Apple devices with Lightning port.
Our Fast-Charge Adapter has been tested and verified to be compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod using both Apple's official USB-Lightning cables and several after-market USB-Lightning cables. Compatibility with Apple devices is guaranteed for Apple's official USB-Lightning cables and other MFi-certified cables. Most non-MFi-certified cables shall work with our adapter as well -- as long as the cable itself is compatible with your device. Our adapter will NOT make a Apple-incompatible cable into compatible one. Please also be advised that many after-market cables are not capable of passing through high charge current (2 Amp or higher) -- thus charging will be limited by the cable's current limit even using our adapter.

Stretch Goal
Our first stretch goal is set at $20,000; once that is reached, (1) a silicone case will be included with each adapter -- the case will make it easier to carry around the adapter while providing some level of protection; (2) a silicone cable tie will be included with each Fast Charge cable to help keep it tidy.

We have done all the following: research, circuit board design, prototype, testing & verification, mechanic design (connector casings), and IC chip selection (total of 3 small chips used for each cable/adapter).
We are seeking fund to make this a reality: tooling, volume purchasing of components, making circuit boards, and final production. Please pledge your support to help make it happen!
The Finer Points
While the we tested and verified that our Fast-Charge Cable/Adapter does everything claimed here, there are a few things that we want to clarify.
Fast-charge relies on a device's built-in capability to be "fast charged". If a phone can accept charge current of 1 Amp, our cable/adapter will make it possible for it to charge at this "speed" on a computer's USB port while regular cable won't. However, if a phone's max charge current is 0.5 Amp, then our cable or adapter won't make it to accept higher current to charge faster. Such a device will be damaged if it is "force-fed" with a higher current -- our cable/adapter won't "force-feed". Most recent middle-range and high-end smartphones support charge current of 1 Amp or higher, but many lower-end ones and old ones only support charge current of 0.5 Amp. The same for tablet -- while in this case, the "good" ones support charge current of 2 Amp or higher, but many "cheap" ones may only support charge current of 1 Amp or lower. Many smaller tablets -- e.g., 7" ones, may only support max charge current of 1 Amp to 1.5 Amp.
Most devices charge at different "speed" depending on battery capacity. E.g., a phone may be charged at 1 Amp or higher when its battery is almost empty; but when battery reaches higher capacity, the max charge current goes down -- e..g, it may only support 0.8 Amp at 70% full.
Similarly, when used with some wall chargers, our cable/adapter make it possible to charge some devices faster than regular cable, the charger itself must have the capability to output the higher current necessary for faster charging. For example, the stock iPhone charger can only output 1 Amp max. Our cable/adapter won't do magic and make it output 2 Amp to charge iPad. That said, our cable/adapter does do the magic when, (1) a charger won't charge certain type of devices due to incompatibility -- e.g., an iPad charger won't charge a Samsung Galaxy Tab; (2) a charger doesn't charge all or certain types of devices due to incompatibility or implementation flaw but its circuitry is indeed capable of high current (e.g., 2 Amp). For the former case, our cable/adapter makes the compatibility issue go away; in the latter case, our cable/adapter will make it possible to take advantage of the charger's full capacity.
Cable matters. While working on this project, we found that many cables on the market are bad -- they can't support high current (e.g., 2 Amp or higher) that's necessary to charge iPad and other tablets at "full" speed. When using our Fast-Charge adapter, be aware of the cable -- some may not support current high enough for fast charging.

Protecting your Home's Largest Door!
Why?  Just check out ABC's news report provided by Florida's Tampa Bay Police:
How does Garage Border Control Work?
The genius behind it is that it is always working for you; it is always watching.  You simply, set-it-and-forget-it.  If you forget to close the door, after the programmed time, Garage Border Control will close it.
The video below demonstrates it in action.  Notice how you will hear a single audio beep when Garage Border control first detects the door open.  If you look really close, you can see the reflection of the LED on the door indicating it continues to see the door open.  Finally, when it is about to close the door, it gives 4 audio beeps spaced about three seconds apart to warn that it is about to do so...
PLAY

What if I want the garage left open?
Who are we to tell you what you can't do!  Garage Border Control lets you easily disable it with a simple (long) push of your garage door button! 
That's right! You can use your existing easily-accessible garage door button to control Garage Border Control.  No need to run wires or have a confusing set of buttons.  Want to turn it back on?  Another simple (long) press of the garage button lets you do that.  In both cases, an intuitive set of audible tones lets you know that Garage Border Control just turned on or off.
Can I change the amount of time the door remains open?
Yes!  The video explains most of the operation.  Simply holding the garage door opener button down for several seconds causes it to start beeping.  Every beep indicates another minute the door is to remain open.   The beeps come rather quickly, so counting up to 15 (for 15 minutes) does not take very long.
What else can it do?
It monitors battery voltage (both undercharge and overcharge).  In addition to trying to keep the batteries at a full charge (very small trickle charge), it also monitors the batteries if they get low. It will give you an audio indicator (similar to how smoke detectors work) to let you know the battery is low.
Finally, it can plug in to home automation and home security systems!  It has a four-port header (one is ground) where the hacker in you can control three features of the device:
1) Override: tie this pin to ground and you will disable the timing feature of Garage Border Control (as well as allow you to operate the door to open (instead of just closing the door))
2) Operate Door:  toggle this pin to ground and the door will operate to close the door (if open).  If in override-mode, you can use this pin to open the door as well.
3) Garage Open Indicator:  This pin (used in conjunction with the ground pin) appears to be an open switch if the door is open, and a closed switch (tied to ground) if the door is closed.  This mechanism can be used to add the garage door as a zone to your home security system.
Who is behind Garage Border Control?
Check out my Bio :-)  I created Garage Border Control almost 20 years ago.  My neighbors, friends, and coworkers all wanted one.  It worked with almost all garage door openers back then.  
First attempt 17 years ago (left) and recent prototype (right)
The first attempt (17 years ago) used a magnet and a reed switch to detect if the door was open.  It used dip switches to set the timer.   However, it did not work with some models.  Furthermore, I didn't know how to expose it to the public (kickstarter didn't exist back then :-P ).  After giving and selling all the prototypes I built (nearly fifty), it stayed on the backburner for almost 14 years.
During those 14 years, my son completed college, and started his career in software development.  He always believed in the product and wanted to help create another version.  So, over the past three years we built several new prototypes, taking lessons I learned from the first prototype. We switched from using a magnet to using an infrared "eye" to see the garage door.  We incorporated a microcontroller in order to work with newer garage door openers as well as add additional features:
Audio warnings when about to close the door
Visible and Audio indicators when the door is open
Visible and Audio indicator to assist during installation
Timer completely programmable
Option to disable the device (for those days when you want to keep the garage door open)
Future-proofing (ability to add additional features).
Lab where we hand build the prototypes (original at the very bottom)
About a year ago, I had an idea. I thought, "I wonder if anyone has ever scanned the entire Internet for vulnerabilities? How could you even do that? I wonder if I could do it from my living room..." So I decided to start an open-source project under a company I started called Hyperion Gray.
I gathered some old laptops, built a Hadoop cluster in my living room (because, c'mon, 'Hadoop' is such a cool word!), and started writing a new kind of web vulnerability scanner (PunkSCAN) that would work on a distributed computing architecture. Then I started spidering the Internet for targets and built a searchable repository using the wonderful and open source Apache Nutch and Solr for whatever I'd find while, well, spidering and scanning the Internet. All of it. Thus began the PunkSPIDER project. PunkSPIDER has a number of uses for us techies and security researchers, but its most interesting use case is to allow average Internet users to check if the websites that they entrust their sensitive data to is leaking it all over the place. Users can do this with little to no knowledge of website security, all through a friendly search engine interface. It is a fully featured search engine to prevent your information from being stolen, by allowing you to see if the websites that you use can be easily hacked.
Along the way, I realized that maybe this wasn't a one-man-with-a-day-job kind of project, so I started looking for help. I happened upon a freelancer calling himself Jay Springbernate (you Java developers might get this silly name - I commend him for having a geeky enough handle that even I didn't get it), who turned out to be a guy named Tomas who would help take this project to the next level, the guy who had all the skills that I didn't but wished I did. Together, with our blood, sweat, tears, nights and weekends and absolutely no 5-Hour Energy or Mountain Dew Full Throttle or whatever (it's true!), we've built up to PunkSPIDER v1.2.
So our hard work has paid off, and our project has been accepted as a topic at ShmooCon 2013! (I may or may not have a genie in a lamp and 2 wishes left...shhh.) So, we're thinking that maybe we're on to something, and, if you've read this far, we're hoping you think so too.
This KickStarter project is our attempt to raise the money to build PunkSPIDER 2.0.  Your generous support will allow us to cover our hosting costs (yeah -- that ramshackle Hadoop cluster in my living room got augmented with a big-boy cloud cluster and the cloud is not free), as well as some of the new and expanded features we're super excited about. Also, your money *may* go to pay for mine and Jay's funeral costs, since my girlfriend and his wife are probably going to kill us if we spend any more time on this project...
Anyway, here's some of our ideas, and since this is an open-source project, your ideas are obviously welcome as well:
Keep it free - PunkSPIDER will always be free, easily usable, and accessible by the general public. Period.
Improved searching - Currently we support searching by website URL, title, and vulnerability type. However we'd like to expand these to include searching by country and additional vulnerability types.
Free vulnerability alert subscription system - We believe that one great use of PunkSPIDER is to check for vulnerabilities in websites that you use. These can cause you to lose tons of personal information through absolutely no fault of your own. We'd like to provide an automated alert system that lets you know if your information is at risk if you inadvertently use an insecure website.
Improve PunkSCAN - We'd like to improve the free and open source engine that runs PunkSPIDER (PunkSCAN). We'd like to make it even faster, more efficient, and more thorough. We believe this would not only benefit PunkSPIDER users but also security researchers that would like to reuse or learn from our unique architecture.
We've done our best to make sure that this project meets all the rules on KickStarter. There's a distinct project start and end point, and we're not moochers -- we're not going to move in, sleep on your couch, drink the last of the milk and ask you if you're going to eat that last slice of pizza (looking at you, Vance).  We hope you like our prizes, which are mostly centered around giving you major street cred for being awesome -- priceless!! (actually, it's a minimum $5...). 
If you love us as much as we love you, spread the word, tell your friends, and throw a few bones our way, if you can. And at the very least, give us feedback -- we're building this for you!
Our Story
                  Hey kickstarter, my name is Kevin Shiflett. I am actually only 15 years old and I created Goto Browser, along with the help of my good friend Brian Zaher, who is also fifteen. Brian and I created Goto Browser in August of 2013. It was the end of summer and I was bored, so to solve my boredom I decided to develop my own app. I had no clue what to make, but after pondering for a few hours I realized that the browser I had on my computer had this annoying ad virus, so I thought why not make my own! Eventually I got really carried away, like I usually do. I started obsessing over making the perfect web browser that anyone could fall in love with. I even brought my best friend to help with the development. After over a year of developing, changing, and designing we believe we have successfully created a browser that is not only an innovation of what the web can be, but also changes the way you think and feel about the web. It took us long days of hard work, determination and patience; in the end it was worth every second. My company, Gotek Software, became officially incorporated on January 27, 2015, and we cannot wait for you to join our community! The company is however owned by my parents, and so is this Kickstarter. Brian and I have a mission to not only make Goto the best browser, but to show that BIG things come in small packages!
What is Goto Browser?
                    Goto browser is a web browser used to not only access the web, but do it in a way that's easier, safer, and intuitive, as well as customizable. We do this by having a simple user interface, yet incorporating many new innovative features that change your overall experience on the web. These features include...
Split Screen Browsing
This feature allows you to split 2, 3, or even 4 tabs onto one screen, giving you the chance to do more on the web than you ever thought.
Goto's Home Screen
Goto gives its user's a completely customizable home screen, in which the users weather, email, and social media timelines all feed into one great place, and its all placed in front of a custom background that can even be a video! it gives a whole new meaning to "There's no place like home."
Password Protected History
As you know one of our key concerns is privacy, so to give users a safe browsing experience while on the web we included password protected history into the browser.
PLAY

Video Backgrounds
Giving users new ways to make their browser unique is one of the things we wanted to do. So we thought what about video backgrounds! This gives you new ways to add style to your browser and make it unique to you. The user can import the video from Youtube or from a file on their computer.
Voice Controlled Browsing
Never touch a button to browse again! Goto can be completely controlled by the sound of your voice. Commands such as go back, go forward, clear history, add bookmark, and more can be said. Not only can you use our default commands, but even create your own custom commands.
Say goodbye to annoying ad viruses
Since we do use Awesomium HTML UI Goto is almost always safe from ad viruses, unlike some browsers. This helps create a safer and less obnoxious experience on the web.
Timeline
Goto is actually almost ready for it's beta, which will release on February 28, 2015. Then we will fix up some bugs that get reported from the beta and release the first official version in September.
 What will your contribution do?
               Even though Goto is just about ready for it's beta we still have a pretty good amount of expenses to cover before and after the beta. Our first expense is getting all the proper licenses to release Goto Browser. We will also have to pay for outside development on fixing and updating the browser so its ready for it's official release in September. These outside sources will make sure that Goto is ready for the release by fixing up the interface and other bugs in the browsers beta. 
Stretched Goal
 If the Kickstarter does go over the set goal the extra pledges will go to the following...
Pre-order RECAP S2
At a Glance, RECAP:
Works with both incoming and outgoing calls
Captures both sides of the phone call conversation
Calls or any audio: Skype, voicemail, music, stream
Compatible with Android, iPhone and most smartphones
Record into PC computer or Digital Voice Recorder
RECAP with PC Computer and Voice Recorder
RECAP is great for:
Professionals:  don't slow down your important business meetings or client calls jotting down notes & asking people to repeat what they just said. Just record the entire call and create meeting minutes or action items after the hanging up!! People will thank you!  As a bonus you may even email them the MP3 of the recording for their records as well!
Podcasters & Reporters: I'm sure you're looking for an low-cost and easy way to route the call audio from your guest interviews into your favorite broadcasting or recording device. Yes, RECAP let you talk normally on a phone call and get that audio into your powerful recording software to manipulate the audio as needed. No need to loose time recording in one spot, then transferring to your computer. 
Everyone else: you may want to record calls with family members, the insurance or credit card company, RECAP is the way to go! Remember all recorded calls will be stored locally in your computer, so no need to worry about your data being stolen in the cloud.  No need to rely on 3-rd party companies for security or privacy.
It's small, it looks nice, and useful!
Advantage of RECAP over other recording alternatives: 
Secure & private: recorded calls are stored locally, never leaving your premise. Don't worry about trusting your very private recordings in the cloud with a 3rd party company. Read article: "8 Reasons to Fear Cloud Computing".
Simple & Yours:  no subscription or pay-per-minute fees. You own the hardware out right and use as little or often as you need. No complicated 3-way calling. 
Future-proof & technology independent: works on any device with a combo port and output into any with a standard stereo MIC port. So it should work 5, 10, 20+ years from now!
Low-cost and Compact: in comparison to professional audio equipment such as a "phone hybrid" which may cost upwards of $400.
RECAP Recording Sound Quality
The sound quality of the recorded call is actually limited by the quality of the call itself, and not RECAP. In other words, RECAP recording will be as good as the phone call quality. Here's an sample recording you can listen to: 
 How does RECAP works?
RECAP taps into the sound going from the headset and the phone, and it puts into the proper signal format for your PC, Voice Recorder. 
The audio from your headset's mic goes into the destination device right channel; 
The audio you listen on you headset goes to the PC left channel (or other destination device)
Functional Diagram
The advantage of recording into separate channels is that you can more easily do sound processing such as amplify the level of only one channel, for example.
Final Product appearance
Below is the texture & finish expected in the production enclosures.
Project Documentation & Incremental progress
April 15, 2013 I finished the very first circuit board iteration for RECAP. After cutting a few circuit board traces and adding few jump wires, I had the electronic design pretty much complete. The board measured 2.50 x 0.80 inches. I then set out to designed the enclosure for the board. 
In May 2013 I purchased a 3D printer, and learned 3D modeling so that by August I had a "great looking" enclosure measuring 2.7" x 1.2" to house RECAP. 
RECAP very first prototype
That first enclosure looked a bit weird because I was still learning the ins and outs of 3d printing. 
My next challenge was to take that design and make it smaller and assembly friendly.
Making it smaller was not only important to improve the user experience of having a more portable device to carry around, but would also reduce materials cost: less ABS plastic for the enclosure, less cost with the circuit board.
Assembly friendly has to with making an enclosure easy to have the board inserted and then sealed. I wanted a design that used no screws and that there was only 2 parts. A shell and a cap. 
By July, I was able to go though a few iterations on the circuit board and enclosure. I managed to shrink RECAP circuit board to measure 0.91 x 0.91 inches. That was a hard limited because of the connector size that I was using. 
Then I started playing with the shape of the enclosure. The square box should in the left would work fine, but was too ugly so I improved the aspect making it more round.
Evolution of enclosure
Once I got the design where I wanted, I started printing the enclosures and performing iterations to verify the ease of assembly aspect. It did take a bunch of iterations for things to work smoothly. Below is one example of an issue I had:
fine-tuning design for easy assembly
Here's a summary of the evolution of the enclosure size.
RECAP Design Evolution
Mid July the original RECAP was all funded in the Kickstarter. With those funds I set out to manufacture 500 devices. About 200 were rewards to backers.
During the manufacturing process I ran into some serious issues such:
Weak ABS filament strength causing the case to crack; 
PCBA manufacturer with poor quality control that shipped boards with missing solder
Slide switch were defective.
Despite those many issues I was able to deliver units on time. It was not easy, I have to put many many rework hours to meet the commitment with my backers. 
After initial delivery, it's now time to stop and fix those issues. My goal is to make RECAP a sustainable product, which has consistent quality of the production process, and there's no need for rework.
I already addressed the filament & PCBA supplier issues. Those items are now under control. Now I need to tackle the slide-switch issue. I have two choices: (1) redesign RECAP to use a more robust switch (2) get rid of the switch.
slide-switch
If we look into the reason Filament & PCBA supplier I now have that under control. Now in regards the slide switch I have two choices: (1) redesign RECAP to use a more robust switch (2) get rid of the switch.
The reason for the switch in the original RECAP is to support multiple phone standards. Here are the 3 standards the original RECAP supported: 
AHJ: iPhone and Android
OMTP: older iPhones, older Androids, older Nokias
Standard headset: cordless phones. 
After surveying users of the original RECAP I found that nearly 100% of users have Android and iPhone (AHJ format), and pretty much nobody anymore uses an OMTP or cordless phones. 
Hence, I decided NOT to redesign RECAP with a new switch, but get rid of the it. By doing so I am creating a more simplified RECAP having the features that people actually use. Introducing the RECAP S2!
Production Plan
May-June 2014: Rework the few of the remaining original RECAP. Remove slide-select switch and solder the board into the AHJ position. Then have the boards installed in the updated 3d printed enclosures.
Enclosures will be manufactured using a 3D printer. Material is white ABS thermoplastic (same plastic as Lego). Resolution will be 0.25mm.
RECAP case will be 3D Printed
July 2014: ship 100 prototype RECAP
May-July 2014:  update the circuit board design to remove the slide-switch, and submit a mass production order with the manufacturer. 500 or 1000 depending on demand. 
Aug 2014:  the batch of circuit boards coming from China is expected to make arrive here in the US. 
Sept 2014: the enclosures will be manufactured using 3d printing technology and the final assembly of the PCB into enclosure likely outsourced to a local resource. 
As a parallel path I'll work with the PCBA supplier and inquire on their interest of delivering the PCB already in an enclosure, since they have 3D printing capabilities..
Fulfillment
All Kickstarter Rewards will ship out my house in Minneapolis. At the moment I do not plan to use a 3rd party fulfillment house. 
I have built capability of shipping hundred items a day. I have shipping software where I can load up entire list of backers into and have the labels printed in a batch of 100+ labels at a time. 
I'm likely seek help for packing and label the rewards to be shipped. 
Important: check your local law to ensure you are complying with the applicable laws pertaining to phone call recording, copying of audio files and however you plan to use RECAP.

With your pledge towards this new piece of technology, McChi Tech can establish manufacturing tooling requirements for mass production. This pledge will allow McChi Lock to spread to various cities, states, and countries. 
TarDisk is the first tool-free upgrade designed for Windows computers that doubles (or even triples) onboard storage. Simply insert TarDisk into your laptop's SD slot and TarDisk instantly mounts onto Windows as an available drive adding up to 256GB of storage. Semi-permanent and Seamless.
Background
Earlier this year we launched TarDisk for MacBook and with the help of over 1,000 amazing Kickstarter backers and pre-order pledges, we built the best onboard storage solution ever offered! During production, we received requests to expand the (MacBook only) TarDisk line to support windows laptops. Today we respond to those request with the first (and only) onboard storage module designed specifically for Windows laptops -- TarDisk Yoga!
Performance
TarDisk Yoga is fast! For many Laptops -- TarDisk is limited only by your computer. It utilizes your computer's SDXC port, and leverages cutting-edge flash controllers to directly transfer data to your system when needed. TarDisk's speeds will reach upto 95 MB/sec Sequential Read* and upto 70 MB/sec Sequential Write* 
*Please note, unlike MacBooks, we have found that some windows laptops have SD ports which operate on slow hubs that limit TarDisk's speed. In these instances, TarDisk will perform to your laptop's limits.
Design
Secure. Simple. Seamless. TarDisk is constructed from a solid aluminum uni-body frame. A block of 6061 Aluminum is precision machined, to within 0.005 inch accuracy. The metal then undergoes a glass bead blasting and anodization process to add wear-resistance and a premium finish.
This isn't just about looks though. TarDisk's design provides both physical protection and performance enhancement. The unique unibody chassis dissipates excess heat generated by the flash chip, providing increased longevity and stability. 
Seamless Fit
TarDisk Yoga is designed specifically for laptops with 16mm SD ports. Our patented design is the first ever created specifically for Yoga laptops. This produces a card with built in removal mechanism that is exactly half the size of a standard SD card. It is paramount that your information is stored securely in your computer without risk of falling out or getting damaged, and our design allows for that. Download and print our measuring tool here to confirm the length of your SD port.
The Manufacturing Plan
Thanks to some awesome backers (just like you,) we have manufactured and sold thousands of TarDisks. Up until now, those TarDisks have only been available for MacBooks. But, that is about to change! Leveraging all of the manufacturing experience and relationships we have built so far, we can offer one of the most efficient Hardware-Kickstarter Campaigns ever!
The money we raise on KickStarter will pay for tooling and machine time, and fund the materials needed for the initial manufacturing batch. By supporting our campaign, you are enabling us to take on a new and improved product line, that otherwise would be over looked!
Uni-body cases. Multi-thousand piece manufacturing setup at a partnered facility here in Mass. Capabilities & production scale quality have been confirmed and terms have already been used and verified for quality and accuracy. 
128GB and 256GB 14mm Chips will be sourced without issue. Capabilities & production scale quality have been confirmed. 
Each piece will feature a new heat sinking adhesive, made with 99.8% pure micronized silver for superior thermal conductivity resulting in added flash memory stability. 
All finish work, packaging and shipping logistics will happen here in the Massachusetts. Assembly is straight forward.
Added Protection
Simply put: TarDisk provides an easy way to double (or triple) onboard Storage in your Laptop. Our Uni-Body-Aluminum, Chip-on-Board design, makes it seamless. Removal, if ever necessary is easy - just use a finger to slide the drive out. You can easily corral your storage space hogs, like your large photo library, music collection or DropBox account onto your TarDisk in a snap. Just remember to never use metal when removing your TarDisk!
Time Line
Next Steps
With fully functional prototypes in-hand, a beautiful design and a time tested manufacturing process TarDisk Yoga is ready to be created for you. Thousands of MacBook customers are delighted with their TarDisks, but in order to cover tooling costs for this new line, we need to ensure that there are Yoga customers who want TarDisk. Now we turn to you, to help us successfully fund the first ever flush solid-aluminum 256GB onboard expansion module specifically for Yoga.
We‰Ûªre humbled that you‰Ûªve taken the time to learn about our project and we sincerely can‰Ûªt thank you enough for the support. None of this would be possible without you! Thank you!
                  
Roomswap is a mobile platform that allows university students to utilize their campus community and swap or find housing in their college town safely, transparently, and affordably.
If you look at any college town, you will see dozens of apartment complexes owned by 4-6 parent companies. These companies offer students 10-13 leases that not only upcharge students but raise rent almost academic year. this is incredibly unfair for students as many of us cannot plan out an entire year of our lives.
With Roomswap, university students can take back their power in a manipulative housing market by offering their space on our platform at a lower rent that competes with the market price offered by the complex they are living in; making their space more attractive to a student in need of housing.
At Roomswap, we want students to skip out on shady real estate agent or apartment complex whose only concern is the bottom line, and instead utilize their own campus community.
Below are the four main features that Roomswap offers within the mobile platform. These features are made to maximize safety, convenience, and money saved for university students.
We have helped dozens of students at the University of Oklahoma; here are a just a few reviews so you can see what students think about Roomswap!
PLAY

Graduates, study abroad students, and interns are our major subgroups that need lease takeovers. Though we have found that students across the board find the need to sublease for several reasons like roommate troubles and changes in college plans. 
As college students, our lives are constantly changing. But the housing leases we're forced to sign (if we want a place to live) do not reflect this. How many students know how their life is going to play out for the next 10-13 months? Not many. We sometimes graduate early, or take a cool summer internship hours away. 
The opportunities we work so hard for shouldn't be overshadowed by $500+ rent per month for x amount of months. No student should feel financially strained because of a housing lease.
Transfers, incoming graduate students, international students, and freshmen are our major subgroups in need of housing. Though we have found that students across the board need to find off-campus housing in their college town at least once or twice within their college career. 
College housing is in high demand; new corporate-owned complexes are sprouting up, and existing ones are upping their rent every single year. This is insanely unfair for university students, as we're already combating rising tuition, an expensive textbook market, and other expenses that come with being a college student.
 We're trying give control back to college students when it comes to off-campus housing. Instead of signing a new lease at that complex around the corner, look on Roomswap and you may find the exact layout you are looking for. You will not only save a student around $2,000, but will also save yourself hundreds of dollars. How, you may ask? Because that student really needs out of their lease - and they will pay you if you're willing to sign.
Below is a step-by-step process of how each service works. (read left to right)
LEASE HOUSING
 NEED HOUSING
To date, Roomswap has saved University of Oklahoma students nearly $24,000 in otherwise unused rent as well as a huge amount of time/stress/energy that they were able to focus on their studies + obligations.
But here's the catch, the company has been run manually so far. We just purchased an online database tool to store students' information in the last few months, but we have still been doing Roomswaps for students by hand, matching them by their needs.
If we continue working manually, we can probably help students at OU save up to $50,000. This is a huge chunk of money, but definitely modest in terms of our goals.
We wish to expand to the University of Texas, and then continue on to going national. We want to save students at least $1 million dollars in rent, if not way more. With the development of our new mobile housing platform, we will be able to match students at a much faster rate, helping students all across the nation! 
Here is a little preview of some of the awesome rewards we're offering!

The 3D-Printed Crew Of #QuinSaga
We're here on Kickstarter asking for your help funding the development of three 3D-printable, kaiju-inspired monsters from the planet Filamento! This is a new line of characters in our 3D-printable Quin Universe. (#QuinSaga) To date with a lot of help from supporters like you, we've created Quin, NiQ, Boon, and RukiBot. ...We hope these 3 monsters will be the next round of creations from 3DKitbash.com! - Now on with the story...
Monsters are teleporting through 3D printers and we need your help to destroy them!
The evil monsters of Filamento are preparing for an invasion to claim technologies from here on Earth!
To fight these monster, designate your 3D printer as a "Landing Zone!" By working together and printing the monsters all over the planet we will diffuse their energy and cause the beasts to print at manageable (fightable) sizes. The more 3D printers on our side, the better!
After many sleepless nights watching the longe-range scanner we now have a clear look at the incoming creatures! - Here's what we know so far...
TONPINK
CLASS: 2.0 Atmospheric Assault
Height: 3 Meters / Wingspan: 7 Meters / Weight: 1 Ton
A very fast and maneuverable creature, Tonpink is often utilized as a scout or early assault unit for the monster swarms. He's not very big in size, but his ability to quickly and accurately teleport, while also delivering attacks, make him a devastating creature to encounter. Special Chef's Note: His claws can be harvested to eat.
Tonpink's Special Attacks
Teleportation: Has the ability to teleport through 3D printers. He can also teleport freely within non-digital environments very quickly.
Psionic Ping: Can vibrate and clang claws to confuse and disorient nearby units.
Vacuum Slash: Can swipe claws with such speed that a ripple vacuum is formed and thrown as a projectile. This can stun and/or rip apart on contact with target.
Ejectable Limbs: Has ability to readily release a wounded or captured limb. Limbs can regenerate and can be used as a projectile.
MURKAGON
CLASS: 3.5 SIEGE Tank
Height: 30 Meters / Weight: 16,000 Tons
Be it swimming in a choppy sea or lumbering across an active battlefield, Murkagon is a walking fortress! Often used as a 'tenderizer' by his monster comrades, Murkagon is often sent into a battle zone early due to his high resilience to external assaults and ability to continuously release debilitating attacks that aide the other monsters.
Murkagon's Special Attacks
Teleportation: Has the ability to teleport through 3D printers. He can also teleport freely within non-digital environments, although somewhat slowly.
Mega Ton Tongue: Tongue can be used as a battering ram to destroy fortifications and buildings.
Acidic Gut Gas: Can release large clouds of acidic burps that linger in the air and cause ongoing damage and impairments.
MEGA Electro Pulse: Can release a huge electromagnetic pulse that can effectively wipe out any unprotected electronics. This attack (at this size) can cause confusion in fellow monsters.
GANKRA
CLASS: 5.0 Destroyer
Height: 48 Meters / Length: 105 Meters / Weight: 22,000 Tons
We don't know much about Gankra at the moment...He was not an inhabitant of Filamento before the initial assault to find Quin. We do know that he's vicious, big, and holds a command-like position within the enemy ranks. He will often direct attacks and wait for the target to become compromised, before moving in himself to finish the job. From what we can tell, this is a very intelligent and calculating beast.
Gankra's Special Attacks
Teleportation: Has the ability to teleport through 3D printers. He can also teleport freely within non-digital environments, although slowly.
Stun Stomp: Can release a pulse of energy (triggered by a stomp) that can stun nearby creatures. Not effective on flying units.
Bone Shards: Can launch jagged shards by whipping his tail and boney spikes at the opponent.
Shock Skin: Skin can be electrified to deter physical attacks.
Electro Pulse: Can release an electromagnetic pulse that can effectively wipe out any unprotected electronics.
Fusion Blaze: Gankra's body will begin to glow ominously before he lets loose with a concentrated blast of electromagnetic radiation from his mouth.
 Here is a scan of Gankra's skull... Niq and Boon managed to get this before escaping.

Additional Points Of Interest About These Monsters:
Monsters parts can 3d print within 100x100x100 mm space
Some monster parts will be useable by other #QuinSaga characters
Monsters will feature hinged jaws
Monsters will feature multiple points of articulation
Monsters will 3d print without support materials needed
From here on out it's all about watching and waiting to see how this plays out. Start stockpiling your ammo and sharpening your pointy things... because the belligerent beasts will be here before you know it. ...and that's when everything might change. So get ready!
Quin liked her Giant RukiBot so much that she opted to match his color palette.
If you feel that you're going to need additional help fighting the beasts, please refer to the higher backer levels. There you will be able to have a selection of the #QuinSaga characters assist you with the coming fight.
Choose the ASSAULT SQUAD LEVEL and you will receive All 3 Monsters, RukiBot, and Boon at your location!
Boon and RukiBot investigate the fearsome maw of Gankra - At the highest levels, you can get Boon's and RukiBot's backup support fighting the monsters!
....or choose the MONSTER ATTACK PACK LEVEL, and you'll intercept All 3 Monsters, plus RukiBot, Boon, Quin, and NiQ will arrive to help you battle the beasts! Quin and NiQ will each come in their "To Infinity" gear, complete with jet packs, ray guns, and plenty of ports for utility pins - a deluxe setup!
Quin Saga Cast of Characters: Quin, NiQ, Boon, RukiBot
Some of Quin and Niq's To Infinity gear will work with RukiBot!
Some folks have Stretch Goals, but we prefer Stretch 'Rewards'. As we get higher backing, you can expect to get more stuff from us. ...So please share this Kickstarter with your 3D Printing community.
These new monsters are Quin's evil adversaries, and they're coming to spice up the story-line! Each monster will be an original design, created by Quincy Robinson, and inspired by his life-long love for vintage Japanese "Kaiju" movies, television shows, and vinyl toys (think of the kaiju in Ultra Man and Godzilla).
The monsters will be thoughtfully-engineered for the very best desktop 3D printing experience. They'll print support-free, and there will be no need for glue.
Supporters all over the world are printing their 3DKitbash characters and posting pics of them involved in the action on our Facebook Page and Instagram Feed (@3DKitbash)! Search #QuinSaga and join the fun!
We hope you'll back this Kickstarter and be a part of developing these monsters. Please back us today and share this campaign far and wide! Thank you so much, backers! We really appreciate all your support, past and present. Subscribe To Our Email List to stay up to date on all the fun!

Storing Bitcoins securely with paper wallets
Making a paper wallet shouldn't be a hassle, but currently it is.  You have to download a LiveCD, make sure it has bitcoin software on it, burn the CD, reboot your computer, go into the BIOS and make sure the CD is selected as the first boot device, then boot into the LiveCD, install and configure your printer, etc.  
Piper makes creating paper wallets easy.  
Piper is a hardware-based paper wallet generator and printer.  It's easy to use, and yet fully customizable.  Piper has a single button which creates a new paper wallet when pressed.  Piper also has an HDMI port and a USB port, so you can hook up a TV/Monitor and Mouse and Keyboard, and customize your prints or even use your own USB printer.
How does Piper work?
Piper has a single button which creates a new paper wallet when pressed.  Piper also has a mode switch which is used to switch between "Remember" and "Forget" modes.  When Piper is in Remember mode, the paper wallets you print will be backed up on Piper's internal memory.  If you plug in a USB drive, Piper will automatically back up the keys used to make the paper wallets it has printed.  When Piper is in Forget mode, the paper wallets will not be stored internally.
How do I know I can trust the private keys that Piper generates?
Piper is 100% open source, so you can clearly see how the paper wallets are generated.  Piper has no internet connection, so nobody can ever steal your private keys and therefore your bitcoins.  Piper has passed 26 of the Dieharder tests of randomness, and every unit includes this test so you can run it yourself and verify the randomness of the private keys generated.
What does Piper look like?
Piper's enclosure is a ~4" cube made of transparent green acrylic.  Piper has a switch and a button on top.  The switch allows you to switch between "Remember" and "Forget" modes.  The button allows you to print a paper wallet.
What powers Piper?
A Raspberry Pi Linux computer generates the keypairs, and a small printer creates the paper wallets. 
What does Piper come with?
A power supply compatible with 100-240VAC and 1 roll of paper.  Extra rolls can be purchased on the piperwallet.com website.  Each roll is enough for more than 100 paper wallets.
How long do the paper wallets last?
The paper wallets will last 7 years or more if stored properly.  Storing them properly means cool, dry, office filing type conditions.
Quickly, easily, and securely connect your Arduino Unos, Leonardos, Dues, and Megas (and their chipKIT counterparts) to the outside world without having to solder any of those pesky wires!
Second time's a charm!
It's DÌ©jÌÊ vu, all over again - almost. You may have seen us here before with a larger funding objective. Well, that was too ambitious, but we really, really want to make these boards available. We took what we learned from the first go-round, went back to the financial and sourcing drawing board, found a lower cost supplier, and tightened our belts. This is the same project, but with a smaller funding goal. The rewards are the same, but come at lower pledge amounts.
It's Open Source!
Even better, in the spirit of the Arduino community, our Proto-Shield will be Open Source! Once this Kickstarter project is completed, we will release the design files for anyone to download under an Open Source license.
What is a Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield?
The great thing about Arduinos is that they are so easy to interface to the outside world ‰ÛÒ to monitor the state of sensors and to control actuators and make things happen. As part of this, you often need to add a few components or circuits of your own, and the best way to do this is by means of a prototyping (proto) shield. Unfortunately, most proto-shields don‰Ûªt make it particularly easy to actually connect wires to and from the outside world. The Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino ‰ÛÒ which works with Uno, Leonardo, Due, and Mega Arduinos (and also their chipKIT counterparts) ‰ÛÒ addresses this issue by means of its easy-to-use screw-block terminals.
The Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino features two boards as shown below (note that the final boards may be a different color and there may be minor engineering ‰ÛÏtweaks‰Û and differences to the prototypes shown here).
The Master Board on the left below works with Arduino Unos and Leonardos. If you are using a Due or a Mega, you will also require the Expansion Board on the right.
Backside below. Master on the right, Expansion on the left.
Below we see what a fully-assembled Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master Board will look like with an Arduino Uno (an Arduino is not included with the Proto-Shield system). On the left we see the two boards on their own; on the right we see two views of the Master Shield plugged into the Arduino Uno.
Below we see what a fully-assembled Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master and Expansion Board combo will look like with an Arduino Mega (an Arduino is not included with the Proto-Shield system). At the bottom we see two views of the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master and Expansion Board combo plugged into the Arduino Mega.
How Does it Work?The screw-block terminals featured on the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino make it easy-peasy to connect your Arduino to the outside world.
Of particular interest is the capriciously cunning dual-pad system employed by our Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shields. The few existing screw-block proto-shields that do exist typically have each screw-block terminal directly connected to its associated header pin and a single pad in the prototyping area as illustrated below. The problem is that sometimes you want a screw-block terminal to be connected to its header pin, but sometimes you don‰Ûªt. For example, you might want to insert some components between the terminal and the header pin. In the case of our Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shields, each screw-block terminal and associated header pin are connected to two separate pads. If you want the terminal to be wired directly to the header pin, you can easily connect the two pads together; otherwise, you can easily connect the pads into the prototyping area.
If you are anything like us, you will have a number of Arduino-based projects on the go at the same time. Depending on your mood, you might start working on one, then swap over to another, and swap back again later. The real hassle comes when you have to unplug lots of external sensors and actuators and other devices. Many people end up purchasing multiple Arduinos to get around this issue.

This is where the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino is worth its weight in gold. If you create each project on its own Proto-Shield, then you can use a single Arduino ‰ÛÒ all you have to do is quickly and easily swap your Proto-Shields in and out. These shields are also great for educational users ‰ÛÒ students can implement their projects on their own proto-shields and then share a common Arduino.

The Answer to Your I2C Hassles!
Some shields communicate with the Arduino using the 2-pin I2C interface; the problem is that the various Arduinos use different pins to support the I2C interface. Below we see a typical scenario from one of Max's real-world hobby projects. Max is using a Mega, but the I2C-based LCD display was originally designed for use with an Arduino Uno. The result is that the boards have to be connected using flying leads.
Happily, the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino allows I2C-based Uno shields to work with the other types of Arduino. Below we see the LCD shield on the top, the Ardunio Mega at the bottom, and the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master and Expansion Board combo in the middle. The yellow and green wires connect the Arduino's Mega's I2C pins to their corresponding locations on the Arduino Uno.
Now, using the Arduino-Proto-Shield-LCD sandwich, the LCD shield can be added to the stack without the need for any flying wires as shown below:
The Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System also allows I2C-based Arduino Uno shields to work with Arduino Leonardos and Dues. Don‰Ûªt worry if any of this is confusing, because the documentation supplied with Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield system will explain everything in excruciating detail.

Our Story
In addition to authoring well-known books on electronics and computing, Max is a renowned EETimes editor specializing in Microcontrollers, Circuit Boards, Programmable Logic, and Prototyping. Duane is the marketing manager and blog author at Screaming Circuits, which specializes in assembling prototype and short-run circuit boards. In their spare time, Max and Duane design and construct all sorts of electronic and computing ‰ÛÏstuff,‰Û from brainwave amplifiers to telepresence robot avatars (be afraid, be very afraid).

One of Max‰Ûªs current hobby projects is a Pedagogical and Phantasmagorical Inamorata Prognostication Engine (don‰Ûªt ask). This little beauty features a cornucopia of antique switches, knobs, dials, and meters, all controlled by an Arduino Mega plus a collection of shields. There were two problems with the original design: existing Mega proto-shields don‰Ûªt include screw-block terminals and I2C-based Uno shields cannot easily be plugged into a Mega. Max talked to his chum Duane, a robotics expert who designs his own circuit boards. Between them, Max and Duane came up with the galaxy‰Ûªs most Universal Proto-Shield System ‰ÛÒ anyone working with an Arduino (or a chipKIT equivalent) needs one of these little beauties.

The Rewards
If you are feeling adventurous, you can simply purchase a bare (unpopulated) Master Board or Master-Expansion Board combo, and then source the other components ‰ÛÒ headers, screw terminal blocks, and reset switch ‰ÛÒ yourself (we'll provide details as to these components and some suppliers in the documentation accompanying the boards). Alternatively, you can purchase complete kits that include all of the components.

Of course, you'll still need solder and a soldering iron but we'll talk about these in the instructions, and we'll also point you towards some online soldering tutorials if you need them.

In addition to detailing how to assemble the boards, the documentation accompanying your Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino will also cover how to use them to make I2C-based shields designed for use with Arduino Unos work with Arduino Leonardos, Dues, and Megas (and their chipKIT equivalents).

Production plan (or "How we learned to stop worrying and love the board"). The Internet doesn't have a "do what I'm thinking button" yet, so we had to actually plan this out.
Step 1: The idea
Completed, otherwise we wouldn't be here.
Step 2: Design the first prototype
Completed. In fact, we've made, ordered, received, and are currently using three revisions of the design already.
Step 3: Complete the Kickstarter application
Completed. The Kickstarter process is well thought out and educational.  It does a great job of getting everything in focus before a project is launched.
Step 4: Find sources and quote the materials
Completed. We have two options for sourcing the PCBs (and others as backups). Also, all of the components have been quoted in multiple different quantity levels.
Step 5: The Kickstarter campaign itself
In progress. Assuming a start date of 3/27/14, and running for 30 days, the campaign will end 4/26/14.
Step 6: Ordering the materials
Depending on the end volume, PCBs will be ordered on either a three or a four week lead time. That can be a painfully long time to wait, but it's what makes this project affordable.
The components are coming from three different suppliers. They'll arrive about three weeks after placing the orders.
Other supplies (e.g., mailing envelopes, shipping labels, parts bags) will, again, be ordered from multiple suppliers. Shipping lead times on these items will vary from one to three weeks.
All of the orders will be placed immediately at the end of the campaign. We anticipate being in possession of all of the items toward the end of May.
Step 7: Fulfilling the Early Bird awards
The Early Bird awards are PC boards only. The boards are dependent upon fewer suppliers, which will make fulfillment quicker. We'll ship the 100 Early Birds as soon as we receive the boards, so they should be winging their way before the end of May.

Step 8: Fulfilling the remaining awards
We will package and ship these immediately following the Early Birds. Depending on the final volume, this could take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

We anticipate that all of the rewards, except the Monty awards, will be fulfilled during the month of June. We will start fulfilling the Monty awards immediately following fulfillment of the Early Bird and Whole Shebang awards.
Quick poll: Do you think your computer's security is more like Fort Knox or a Paper Bag? If you're like most people, you're probably closer to the paper bag - and this book is for you!
This is a book about computer security for normal people! In this book I lay out a wide range of professional tips for greatly increasing your security, using language that everyone can follow and a style that‰Ûªs easy to read. I will use helpful analogies to explain technical topics and throw in some fascinating, real-life stories to drive the points home.
If you‰Ûªre short on time, you can skip straight to the step-by-step checklists; but if you want to actually understand why you‰Ûªre doing it, I explain that, too!
This book really is about the bare minimum stuff that everyone should do to keep themselves safe - like wearing a seat belt, installing smoke alarms, and putting on sunscreen.
Covers: PC's (Windows) & Macs (OSX), including some tips on mobile devices (smart phones, tablets)
Non-Techie Version (for regular people)
This book is for my mother, my friends, my neighbors, and all the other totally normal, everyday people like them: people who use computers, but don‰Ûªt really know (or frankly care) how they work. This book is for people who just want to know what they need to do to protect themselves - step by step, without lots of jargon, and without judgment. I‰Ûªve structured this book to give you the maximum benefit with the smallest amount of effort (and cost). The purpose of this book is to cut to the chase and clearly explain the bare minimum things you need to do to protect yourself in this increasingly-connected world of ours. Along the way, if you want to learn a little of the ‰Û÷why‰Ûª and ‰Û÷how‰Ûª, in language you can understand, I‰Ûªve included a good bit of that, too.
So, what will this book really do for me, you ask? To put it simply, it‰Ûªs going to make you safer - significantly safer, if you follow most of the advice. In fact, it will not only make you safer, it will make those around you safer, even if they don‰Ûªt do any of the things I recommend in this book. If you read the book cover to cover (though you don‰Ûªt have to), you will be armed with enough knowledge to see through the hype from the media, government and corporations and understand the real risks. And finally, it will help you be an informed citizen when it comes time to vote - either at the ballot box or at the cash register.
But can‰Ûªt I find all of this information on the web, you ask? Sure you can! The problem is not lack of information - the problem is that there is too much. How do you find what you need and weed out the stuff you don‰Ûªt? Most people wouldn‰Ûªt even know what to search for. Even if you knew some of the technical terms, you‰Ûªd still have to collect all the info and figure out what parts are relevant to you. To make matters worse, the common news sources that most people turn to have done a horrible job covering these topics (when they cover them at all). They tend to focus on the wrong things and generally give poor advice. There are lots of good sites that get it right, but you‰Ûªve probably never heard of them and they tend to be very technical. If only someone could find all the most important stuff, break it down into manageable pieces, and explain it so anyone can get it‰Û_ well, for a small investment, I will deliver just that!
Techie Version (for computer nerds)
If you‰Ûªre a techie person, then you‰Ûªre probably the go-to ‰ÛÏIT guy‰Û (or gal) in the family. Your friends constantly ask you for advice when buying a computer. Your relatives email you whenever their Mac is ‰ÛÏacting funny‰Û. And your college-aged niece who downloads tons of ‰ÛÏfree‰Û music and movies can‰Ûªt understand why her PC is riddled with viruses. If you‰Ûªre a real softie, you probably forward them emails about scams to watch out for, web sites to avoid, and suggestions on how to protect their privacy. Most of the time, your advice is never followed, unless you give them detailed, step-by-step instructions or just do it for them. Remote desktop sharing has saved you much time and effort, but it‰Ûªs still frustrating trying to keep your friends and loved ones safe and up to date.
This book isn‰Ûªt for you. It‰Ûªs for them. You already know most of this stuff, or at least know where to find it. But the rest of humanity is just not getting it, despite your heroic efforts. This book is going to be the stocking stuffer you give to everyone in your family. It‰Ûªs the book you issue to each friend that buys a new computer. It‰Ûªs the book that‰Ûªs going to save you countless hours explaining to Aunt May why she needs to have more than one password, or answering your neighbor‰Ûªs constant questions about which anti-virus software he should be using, or helping your mom remove ten different Internet Explorer toolbar ‰ÛÏhelpers‰Û so that she can actually see more web page than buttons.
The purpose of this book is to walk the average, non-techie person through the basic things that everyone should do to protect their computers and their data. It also takes the time to explain why these things are important and how they work, at a high level. This is the stuff you wish you had time to explain to all your friends and family. With a small donation, you can help me to help you!
About Me
I‰Ûªm a software engineer and I‰Ûªve been doing computer stuff professionally for over 20 years now (and unprofessionally since I was a kid). I was sending emails before AOL was filling your mailbox with CDs and I‰Ûªve been surfing the world wide web since it began in the early 90s. I use multiple computers on a daily basis, for a living and for fun. I personally own six computers at this very moment: one running Windows, two running Linux, and three running Mac OSX. Basically, when it comes to computers and the internet, I‰Ûªve been there, done that. In recent years, I've become extremely interested in computer security and privacy. I find myself constantly sending emails to my friends and family, giving them a heads up on the latest scams and viruses, keeping their systems updated, and generally trying to educate them about the dangers as well as the hype. I‰Ûªve always got my ear to the ground, following techie blogs, listening to security podcasts, and even reading books on encryption and cryptography - for fun! But honestly, there are plenty of people with more geek cred than me. The final qualities that set me apart are a) the ability to explain technical stuff to non-technical people, and b) the desire and patience to actually do so.
Working Title
The title is still a work in progress and may yet change. I will probably at least add a subtitle. (I'm open to suggestions!) Throughout the book I will use analogies to explain technical topics, and explaining the many layers of castle defenses is an excellent analogy for computer security. The idea that spawned the title is that security is about trade offs: time, cost, effort and convenience versus risk of attack and consequences of a breach. Trying to make a castle dragon-proof makes no sense - the cost would bankrupt the kingdom! So you focus on the more common risks (i.e., people).
    WEB ARMORY was designed to look "Deceptively Simple", but its really High Tech.  It also was meant to be Extremely Easy to use, because it was meant for everyone-to help protect your personal Privacy and Security online.
  If you are worried about "Big Brother" knowing what you do online, or your Internet Service Provide (ISP) monitoring what websites you visit, or you are concerned about everything Edward Snowden has leaked about spying agencies... Than you need WEB ARMORY!
   One of the main purpose of the Armory was to seamlessly enforce new and correct encryption protocols, to help defend your Personal and Private Data, Credit Cards number, Passwords, Bank accounts, online credentials, browsing habits... all while you are online.
  Everything in Web Armory is designed to leave no trace you where online or even on a particular computer. So you can use it at Work(without getting into trouble for the IT guys), using some ones else's computer(doesn't leave a history), traveling, internet Cafe's, etc
  WEB ARMORY, absolutely DOES help! It provide you with an "Armory" of Tools (specifically developed internet browsers) that helps you remain Secure and maintain you Privacy while online; or simply disappear.... 
Its that simple. Being anonymous, Secure and Private online, has never been this easy.  :)
   For more in depth information, just go to www.WebArmory.org to see how it protects you from "Digital Fingerprinting" techniques. :) 
The information provided below, is lighter information about Web Armory, so I don't bore you to death!!!
WEB ARMORY works just like the internet browsers you use at home, but our Internet Browsers are way more Private, Secure & use Encryption to protect you while you are online. And it's portable(on a USB), so you can take it anywhere, to be truly secure and private while online, anywhere you travel in the World!
... Because ANYONE with a computer or cell phone has the means to steal, 'Hack' or invade your privacy; while you are online or offline and you wouldn't even know it.
  Without encryption... ANYONE with a computer or cell phone has the means to steal, 'Hack' or invade your privacy; while you are online or offline and you wouldn't even know it.
   Web Armory loads from a USB Credit Card or an Encrypted USB, on to your computers RAM. Which means your online activity is 'sandboxed' away from hard disk or other programs that may be linked to your computers browsers. It also means that all your browsing activity, DNS info, and other activities you did online, will disappears without a trace, once you shut Web Armory down. 
  They work like popular Web browsers.... but way more Private and Secure.

The Idea - Create an RFID Tracking system for my school as my Senior Seminar Project. You walk up to the door, swipe your student ID and the door will unlock. You grab your gear, swipe your card to get out of the room and as you walk out the tags on the gear send the information to the computer and the monitor next to the door displays your name, what you have and your email address if someone needs something you have.
The Plan - Unfortunately I cannot disclose specifics about hooking the system up for security purposes. However, I can say that the system is very secure and it will allow students to stop filling out papers to check gear out and just grab what they need and go.
The Money - The money you give me will allow me to purchase key card door locks from gokeyless.com, a RFID system and RFID tags from Capture Tech (capturetech.com), a computer from newegg.com, a monitor and a wall mount from Walmart, and all the necessary cabling to hook it all up.
If you would like to follow my progress, please check out rfidadventure.wordpress.com. I will update the blog as often as possible with videos and pictures about how it is going.
Our current website does not represent our goal product and may not work right until the official launch. The sole purpose of the website is to release public testing versions.
David and Jimmy started Lockin so users from around the world could upload files quickly and not have to be worried about prying eyes.
The 500 dollar goal for Lockin is so we can set up our servers and put apps on the Play Store and Apple Store for free. Donating to Lockin will also give you some awesome merchandise.
We pledge to keep your data safe, secure and offer you the most up to date security protocols and not sacrifice ease of use and design. Are you ready to join the Lockin?
So now your probably wondering how exactly will Lockin work when its finished. We want users to upload a file and set a time limit and download limit for each file. After the time or download limit is reached the file and data associated with it is deleted forever (unlike other companies who store your files after you deleted them) because we believe that users should have 100% control over their data. We will have some type of secure account database where you can control all of your live files and track there statistics, while staying anonymous to organizations that may want to steal or sell data. We believe that having a lot of security shouldn't make it harder for anyone to use the service, so we are designing a clean and simple interface to go along with the secure back-end of Lockin.
We are working on testing versions https://lckin.com. We will be releasing updates to the service every month or so until we become stable.

WHAT IT IS
SimpleSafe is an application that uses several different encryptions (MD5, SHA-1 are the currently working ones) to encode a phrase into a safe and secure password compliant with most websites. This translation into a password will take place the same way every time you input your phrase, thus your password will be secure but more accessible to YOU. SimpleSafe will be a cross-platform tool, available as a Web App powered by Javascript, and by PHP for those without Javascript. It will also be available as an Android app. And with time, it may be available as an extension for Chrome, Firefox, and a widget for Windows, Linux etc. The application is simple but powerful.
WEBAPP DEMO:
http://www.youtube.com/watch...
WHY USE IT?
Most websites require a password that is 6-12 characters long and contains both numbers and letters. The days of having a "123456"-type passwords are long gone, and trying to remember a complicated string of numbers and letters (like "1ieo235") is getting difficult. We, then, tend to rely on a single password for all of our accounts online. However, what happens when a breach happens on one of those sites? We've all witnessed what happened at Gawker, where the password database was retrieved by hackers. The information was disseminated through torrents. So now, everyone has those passwords, ready to get into your accounts. Now, you have to go through all those sites where you have an account, change your password, remember the new password. It's just a hassle. Why not remember one phrase for each site and convert it into a secure password? Or when, if you keep just one password for all your sites, your accounts get hacked, why not just change the encryption type for your phrase? (SHA-1 passwords look NOTHING like MD5)
SimpleSafe makes this whole process easier. No, it doesn't change passwords on all your sites, but it does create passwords for you in a very simple manner. And those passwords will be retrievable by you.
HOW TO WORK IT
Here is how to use the application:
1. Enter a word/phrase that you can easily remember (your dog's name, your name, etc.)
2. Choose an encryption (MD5, SHA-1)
3. Get the password in different lengths
4. Use the password
The application converts your phrase, without saving it anywhere, through MD5 or SHA-1 encryption and then spits out the result which is several different password lengths, 6-12 characters long, so that you can pick and choose.
The password will always be accessible through SimpleSafe just by re-entering your word/phrase and choosing the encryption. That's the beauty of the application. The simplicity of craeting an easily-retrievable complicated password. Remember, the application NEVER saves your phrases/passwords, or any information about you.
WHY NOT USE A PASSWORD MANAGER
You know, as well as I do, that password managers are unreliable. Your computer crashes, password manager is gone. Or you have to port your password manager to different browsers, find ways to make it work on your phone, etc. You get the point. If you use an online password manager, you face the same problem as before. Remember a complicated password, and hope that site does not get hacked. And it may be hard to access where you need it. Many password managers require complicated syncs with your phone, different computers. Logging in into an online password manager in public places is extremely dangerous (more dangerous than logging in into other places, I believe).
DEVELOPMENT
The idea is done, that's the hard part. The easy part is coding it, that's actually done too. I already have the Android application (without a decent interface however), and the javascript version too (no decent interface yet either). I will be able to develop the PHP version and the interfaces in no time, however, I do need space to make all of that work.
What I don't have right now, and need are a domain where I can place SimpleSafe (such as simplesafe.net), additional hosting, a market license for Android, and any additional, related fees covered.
As you can see, this project can be finished soon, and easily without problems.

FUTURE OF THE APPLICATION
In the future, I'd like to continue spreading the application out. As I've said, initially, the application will be available online, and on android. I'd like to create widgets for Windows and Ubuntu/Linux. I'd also like to add a "store" functionality of your phrases, OFF-LINE only, so that no information gets stored online (a major vulnerability, I think). I'd like to add an extension for Chrome and Firefox so that the application is further spread out.
I'd like to keep adding encryption types alongside MD5 and SHA-1. I'd also like to add an encryption type that will convert your phrase/word into a password that does not consist of letters and numbers only. As website security evolves, other symbols are becoming allowed, and sometimes even mandatory. I'd like to add an encryption which adds exclamation marks, commas, and periods.
    WEB ARMORY was designed to look "Deceptively Simple", but its really High Tech.  It also was meant to be Extremely Easy to use, because it was meant for everyone-to help protect your personal Privacy and Security online.
  If you are worried about "Big Brother" knowing what you do online, or your Internet Service Provide (ISP) monitoring what websites you visit, or you are concerned about everything Edward Snowden has leaked about spying agencies... Than you need WEB ARMORY!
   One of the main purpose of the Armory was to seamlessly enforce new and correct encryption protocols, to help defend your Personal and Private Data, Credit Cards number, Passwords, Bank accounts, online credentials, browsing habits... all while you are online.
  Everything in Web Armory is designed to leave no trace you where online or even on a particular computer. So you can use it at Work(without getting into trouble for the IT guys), using some ones else's computer(doesn't leave a history), traveling, internet Cafe's, etc
  WEB ARMORY, absolutely DOES help! It provide you with an "Armory" of Tools (specifically developed internet browsers) that helps you remain Secure and maintain you Privacy while online; or simply disappear.... 
Its that simple. Being anonymous, Secure and Private online, has never been this easy.  :)
   For more in depth information, just go to www.WebArmory.org to see how it protects you from "Digital Fingerprinting" techniques. :) 
The information provided below, is lighter information about Web Armory, so I don't bore you to death!!!
WEB ARMORY works just like the internet browsers you use at home, but our Internet Browsers are way more Private, Secure & use Encryption to protect you while you are online. And it's portable(on a USB), so you can take it anywhere, to be truly secure and private while online, anywhere you travel in the World!
... Because ANYONE with a computer or cell phone has the means to steal, 'Hack' or invade your privacy; while you are online or offline and you wouldn't even know it.
  Without encryption... ANYONE with a computer or cell phone has the means to steal, 'Hack' or invade your privacy; while you are online or offline and you wouldn't even know it.
   Web Armory loads from a USB Credit Card or an Encrypted USB, on to your computers RAM. Which means your online activity is 'sandboxed' away from hard disk or other programs that may be linked to your computers browsers. It also means that all your browsing activity, DNS info, and other activities you did online, will disappears without a trace, once you shut Web Armory down. 
  They work like popular Web browsers.... but way more Private and Secure.
PLAY

 Web Armory is meant for everyone. Not just for Level 10 Computer experts, but it's for your Mother, friends, co-workers or even your Grandmother. Web Armory was made for anyone, who wants and needs more security and privacy while online... anywhere in the World.
