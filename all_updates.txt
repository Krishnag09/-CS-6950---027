ICLOAK Stik vs. ICLOAK Stik PRO and Other Notes

Hello Backers!
Well, we shipped out all but a few devices that we are missing addresses on and most everyone has received their ICLOAK Stiks (both basic and Pro).
The GREAT NEWS is that we have received dozens of great feedback emails and comments and messages and Tweets from proud ICLOAK Stik owners who have been able to use the device and report that it is working great for them!  MOST of our feedback has fallen into this group.
HOWEVER... "MOST" is not good enough for us here at ICLOAK.  We want EVERYONE to be happy and satisfied with what we have created for you.  This update will address a few issues that have come up that we are working on diligently to resolve.
FIRST Topic... ICLOAK Stik vs. ICLOAK Stik Pro (gold edition)
While most everyone read the update where I explained that we had chosen to work with a different manufacturer and that the choice was made with our customers in mind.  We chose a smaller, faster, more expensive and better USB drive to deliver ICLOAK Stik on.
The original plan was to produce ICLOAK Stik Pro on this drive:
ICLOAK Stik Prototype
This was the image we used on the Kickstarter Campaign.  This drive is produced by Kingston, our first production partner.  The drive come in 2 colors, Aluminum and Gold.  This drive is a good drive, BUT it is also only available in USB 2.0 protocol.
In the last update I posted to Kickstarter I posted a video (click here for that update and video) which explained the changes we had made in manufacturing the first devices.  This is where we decided to do a few extra special things for our Backers and the first people that bought ICLOAK Stik.
First we decided to move to a USB 3.0 drive because it loads about 40% FASTER than on the USB 2.0
The drive we chose is 1/2 the size physically than the first one
We also decided to do the packaging in a "First Edition" tin that we could produce here in Florida and we thought it would be a cool little container that our backers could hold onto and use
From our standpoint, it also makes our production and inventory issues simpler as we only have a single device with 2 different loaded softwares on it.  One of the devices is loaded with the "Pro" version and the other with standard.
This is the device we created and have been shipping to everyone.  ALL of these are Aluminum Silver in color.  The only difference is in the software loaded on the device.
ICLOAK Stik First Edition
How do you know which one you have??
In the upper left hand corner of the screen when ICLOAK Stik is loaded, it will say "ICLOAK Stik" or "ICLOAK Stik Pro".  This is how you will know which version you have.
I got a basic version and I want a Pro version now!
If you feel this way you will be happy to know we are working on an update which should be available within the next couple months, that will enable you to upgrade by purchasing additional tools and features.
I have a Pro but it doesn't have ALL the tools on it!  Where is email?  Bitcoin wallet?  Password tool?
Great questions!  We are preparing an update that we will push out soon.  We are shooting for 2-3 weeks from now to release the first major update.  That update will contain the additional features for both ICLOAK Stik and ICLOAK Stik Pro.  
PLUS... we will continue to push out updates, features and bug fixes approximately every couple weeks.
Last point on this topic... If you are truly so upset that you MUST HAVE the gold Kingston USB 2.0 drive version that we showed in our prototype photo, let us know and you can send back the small fast one and we will send you a slower bigger one that is gold.  ;)
SECOND Topic... Delivery of special units for our special backers at the higher levels:
We ran into the development delays which have been posted in previous updates.  Because of those delays and the effort to get thousands of devices out the door to normal ICLOAK Stik and ICLOAK Stik Pro users, we have not completed the special edition ones yet.  However, we are sending an ICLOAK Stik Pro to everyone who is supposed to get a special edition one as an EXTRA bonus.  YOU WILL STILL RECEIVE EVERYTHING you were promised in the rewards at every level.  Hopefully we will have those completed in the next 2 weeks also.
Finally...
Again, thanks for all of the great feedback and supportive comments.  For anyone who is having trouble, experiencing technical difficulties, finds a bug, typo, or if you just have suggestions, PLEASE reach out to us.  We are here.  We are humans just like you except we are kinda geeky!
Feel free to contact us directly at support@icloak.org if you want to ask any additional questions.

ICLOAKå¨ Stik is SHIPPING!

OK Backers... You have all been very patient and it's time for you to get what you have been waiting for!
We started shipping out the official ICLOAKå¨ Stiks last week.  Due to production issues (hardware failures) we didn't get out as many as we wanted to, but now we are in full swing!  Our engineers worked all weekend to make sure our new process for loading software and testing and verifying each and every ICLOAK Stik was working well.
Here are a couple of our hard working peeps folding Quick Start Guides and affixing ICLOAK Stiks to them and packaging them in the new tins.
Packing ICLOAK Stiks
One change that happened over the last 2 months as we were working with our manufacturing partner to get these done was that we ran into problems with getting thousands of units made and tested.  We made a decision that we would let Transcend produce the drive but we are loading ALL of the Stiks right here in Orlando, FL, for a number of reasons...
We trust ourselves.  :)  If we are loading the content then it is even less likely there would be any funny business going on.
We can continue to work on our build scripts and make the process more and more efficient.  It will simply take a while longer to get the process optimal with our partners and we didn't want to delay shipping any longer.
Although it takes us longer and is more expensive to produce this way, we are rapidly developing more features for ICLOAK Stik and making it better every week or so.  By ordering large volumes from our partner, we would always be shipping an outdated version requiring an immediate upgrade.  That's not the experience we want our users to have when they first launch ICLOAK Stik.
We can also keep our inventory better in line with demand as we begin to market the product. If we place large orders we have to decide far in advance how many basic vs. pro Stiks to order.  This way we order the drives blank (engraved only) and then we create them depending on which version we need.  This has the added benefit of allowing us to test various other configurations and applications in the near future.
Here are some closeups...
ICLOAKå¨ Stik First Edition in Tin
ICLOAKå¨ Stik First Edition on Quick Start Guide
Also... These are upgraded USB 3.0 drives, not the 2.0 drives that we had originally promised.  They cost us more, but the performance is worth the price.
We are almost 1/2 way through getting all of the orders out and we should be finished getting them all in the mail by end of business Wednesday.
In Liberty,

Hey Everyone... sorry for the long delay in getting another official update done.  We have had 7 or 8 messages asking for an official update so here it is...
I am not going to go through a long update like normal, but I will be posting another one very shortly (within the next week or two).
First... the GREAT NEWS... we have FINALLY shipped 2 Gold Masters (one for ICLOAK Stik and one for ICLOAK Stik Pro) to our manufacturer 2 days ago!  We should receive the physical Gold Masters on Monday or Tuesday next week.  Once we have these in our hands we will then test to make sure they boot and are exactly what we sent them.  That should only take an hour or less and we will sign off on doing the production run.  From the time we sign off on the Gold Masters, they will have our units built within 10 business days and then they will be shipped to us, we will package them up and start shipping them all out!  YAY!  :-D
REMEMBER... If, for any reason, the Gold Masters are not correct when we get them, unfortunately we will need to have them make new ones and this may delay the process again.  This is the first time we have ever manufactured anything with them, but they have a great reputation and we don't anticipate any issues.
As a special sneak peek I have added a video to this update so you can see the final product as it will ship to you.  We hope you really like it.  As always THANK YOU ALL for your patience, your support!  It means a LOT to the entire team who are working their asses off to get this product out to everyone.

Holiday Update... Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas everyone! This is Eric B. Delisle, ICLOAK co-creator, and CEO of the newly formed ICLOAK Inc. :) This is going to be a brief update and wishing everyone a happy and safe holiday season.
The last update was pretty extensive and since then we have accomplished a ton of work, including acquiring a biometric usb device company (more on that soon). Over the past month we have integrated that team with our DigiThinkIT/ICLOAK team, formed a new company to separate ICLOAK from DigiThinkIT, Inc., and all hands are on deck working to make 2015 a great year for these products. We are looking forward to providing some help to a lot of people who want it.
Today I read a great article by Violet Blue at ZDNet: http://www.zdnet.com/article/charlatans-the-new-wave-of-privacy-profiteers/
It points out how unscrupulous charlatans have jumped on the "me too" privacy bandwagon. Unfortunately, the average, non-tech folks we are trying to help don't understand ANY of this stuff and all marketing language tends to sound the same, even ours! It is a real challenge to get people's attention in our advertisement saturated world and phrases like "Easy to use" and "Protect your Privacy" are the shortest way to convey a much longer and more nuanced explanation of what these technologies can actually help with and what they cannot help with.
To sum it up, "This shit ain't easy!" You can quote me on that.
One of our most exciting advances has been the completion of a solid updating system so that we can ship the product and then support it with updates as we improve it, patch bugs, and add features. This system will also enable our users to download and install entire applications once we make them available.
It is currently looking like we will be able to finalize our first full production run by mid-January with finished, packaged product shipping in January.
The more we work on it, the more features we want to include. With our updater in place, we are feeling better that we can ship without some of the features we want to give everyone and we can push them out as updates after you already have a device that you can start using now.
Some other highlights accomplished since the last update:
- New tool that helps PC users automatically identify the kind of system they have so they know what key to hold down to boot into ICLOAK. Turns out that with all of the PC manufacturers, there are quite a few different ways to do this and we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to know what to do. Now, you can stick ICLOAK Stik into a PC and run a small program that looks at the system and tells you exactly what that system needs you to do (which key to press). Apple is the easiest of all since it is ALWAYS the Option key. ;-)
- On a VERY geeky note... we have built a very cool replacement for the standard Tor controller that comes bundled with the Tor Browser Bundle. This new controller gives us greater flexibility for providing system wide Tor support for other applications beyond the web browser.
- We have redeveloped some core architecture that has taken a lot of time, but now the entire system starts much faster (30% faster) and it is more stable than before
- We have met with a new manufacturer which will give us the ability to have greater control over the actual memory controller chip on the USB drives we put ICLOAK on where we will be able to protect against hidden exploits and provide a better proof system (still working on something automated) so eventually users will be able to self verify the device they have has not been compromised in any way, even at the factory itself.
- We have added a team of engineers that have been working on chip level security, access control and biometric authentication and encryption technology for the last 7 years. They have added a wealth of knowledge and best practices to our team and soon we will be unveiling another product that will provide even more flexibility and features for release sometime next year. Their experience has already helped our current ICLOAK Stik become more secure.
- Lots of bug fixes, a new multi-option startup screen for supporting even more hardware, and a ton of polish.
We have a pretty light schedule over the next 2-weeks with vacations and holidays, but we should have a lot to share in January. 2015 is shaping up to be an incredibly productive year here at ICLOAK and we are all eager to do our part to help people. Technology isn't going away anytime soon and of the 2 sides we could choose, hurting others with technology or protecting and empowering people with it, we choose to protect and empower! Thanks to all of you who believe in this effort and who have put your hard earned dollars behind it. We are committed to making you happy you did.
Also, a HUGE THANK YOU to all of the messages of support we still receive from our incredible, incredibly patient backers!
Lastly, I have been doing a lot of reflection lately on all of this privacy, technology, cyber security stuff since I have been personally buried by this stuff since we started this project a year and a half ago now. It is always worth reminding myself and hopefully everyone else, that we live in an amazing world together. It is filled with great things and not-so-great things and downright horrible things. Focus on the GREAT things and be grateful for what we do have. Put down those iPhones and tablets a little more and put your attention on the HUMAN BEINGS around us.
I hope you all spend a little more time working on a garden, or helping a friend, or appreciating something beautiful. Take a break from the mainstream news that would have us believe that everywhere there is a place, there is conflict, violence, terror, and fear. THIS IS NOT TRUE.
In fact, the world have become a much more peaceful place than it ever has been in history! Here is an old article outlining some of the facts: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/22/world-less-violent-stats_n_1026723.html
We build products that aim to protect people from real threats. However, it is also important to remember that it is just plain false that there are nothing but evil hackers and governments trying to do harm to everyone through their computers. In fact, at least in my opinion, I believe there is much more good that comes from the tech world than bad. That doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to your own privacy and security, but you should do so with a measured mind that seeks out balance, whatever that means for you. I hope we can help that balance in a positive way.
Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!
May you experience Joy and Love and help others do the same.

LOOOONG OVERDUE UPDATE...
3 Comments

Hello Everyone...
This is @Creator, Eric B. Delisle, providing a long overdue update.
We are still busily working on ICLOAK Stik and it is in the home stretch. I know what you are thinking... "home stretch"? That means it isn't ready to ship yet!! You are correct and I want to personally apologize that it is taking longer than any of us want it to take.
ASSURANCES...
I want to mention a few things that won't get your ICLOAK Stik in your hands sooner, but at least you will not be wondering if you have backed a bogus project like some on KS have been.  In short... NO.
We are not going anywhere and we are still perfectly capable of fulfilling ALL our Kickstarter Gifts to all of you.  In fact, hundreds of you have already received T-shirts and Stickers.  While I know this is not why people backed this project, it does demonstrate that we are trying our very best to get this stuff out as soon as possible.
WHY THE DELAYS?
DEVELOPMENT
In software development, a common saying is that the last 10% of the development takes 90% of the time.  Unfortunately, we are not immune to this.  We have had a functioning prototype since we launched our Kickstarter campaign, but a prototype is not a product that you ship to 2,000 people. We ran into some serious delays which were explained 2 updates ago.  Since then, we have had more delays which I will explain in quite a bit of detail below.  If you don't care about the details, feel free to scroll down near the conclusion and check out the latest video of our progress.
Why?  Well, when we develop something and test it on a couple Macs and a few PCs and it is working fine... then, someone tries it in a new environment or with new hardware, often times we find a serious bug. Each time it doesn't work, it can take DAYS to figure out that ONE BUG.
Interface... You may notice a good number of cosmetic changes when you watch the video at the end of this update.  This is because we made wholesale changes to our interface and windowing system.  The new architecture is more stable, more robust, runs faster and looks nicer.  It will also allow us to create some nice features for all of you in future builds.
Filesystem... We made an incredible amount of progress including building our own filesystem from scratch and integrating our new encryption framework into it.  However, it is still going to take some time for us to finish and perfect it before it is going to be ready for the masses.  Instead of taking the time to finish the entire thing we have decided to use an existing filesystem and push ours out as an update when it is available.  Encryption is tricky and needs to be done correctly.  Tiny things like protecting a decrypted password once it is passed into the RAM by adding bogus bits need to be carefully done.  Some bugs we encountered during this cost us an entire WEEK of development time.
Connectivity...Because we use the Tor Browser Bundle, there have been issues with how it creates its connection to the Tor network and the conflicts that creates with other applications (like email or our new updating system) trying to use a connection.  We seem to have that fixed and are testing now.
Updating... It turns out this is a pretty complex issue.  For example, we want to create an update capability that can just update the different parts of the code instead of sending out redundant code.  This has created a number of issues that we have been working on for the past couple weeks alone.  We now have a functioning version that works for doing manual updates, but we still need to test and make sure it will work automatically over Tor.
****IMPORTANT**** We have stopped working on some of the extra "nice" features in an effort to get this device shipped sooner.  So we are concentrating all of our efforts on the last few important bugs, testing, and getting the Update System working well.  This way we can simply provide updates with the new features as we create and test them!
Hardware... In our testing we keep finding systems that have small problems with drivers and devices and more.  For example, when we booted ICLOAK on one older PC the "Fn" key was enabled by default which caused the "number pad" in the middle of the keyboard to spit out numerals when we tried to type letters.  It was something that you could work around, but we don't want people to have to figure that kind of problem out.  By the way... this is ONLY a problem on PC hardware, all the Macs (and most PCs too) we have tested on work fine.
We have a new boot loader now that deals with many issues and has solved a lot, but we still have more to do here.  Our roadmap has us creating a mini database of hardware that would allow ICLOAK to make fine tuned adjustments at startup.  The other fix we are looking at is sending a small window program along on the ICLOAK Stik that you could run when you first put ICLOAK into some machine and it would analyze the hardware and tell you if you need to do something special to boot ICLOAK.
Bluetooth Devices... It turns out that pairing keyboards and mice that are wireless to a system can be a challenge too.  We had to build our own wizard to allow a computer that had a wireless keyboard and mouse to be able to "pair" it to ICLOAK.  We have it working but we are still testing on various hardware.
BUSINESS STUFF
If the development wasn't enough, we are still running a software company too.  To those ends, we have to keep our other clients happy and when we have to work on our clients' projects that takes some time away from ICLOAK development.
Great Changes Happening... Because of the overwhelming response to ICLOAK, I have decided to stop doing almost (some things take time to stop) everything else and move all of our resources to ICLOAK and its future.
To plan for the future we have created an entirely new company called, ICLOAK, Inc. We have transferred the work we have done at DigiThinkIT, Inc. to ICLOAK, Inc.  In fact, I am actually traveling this week to start my "dog & pony" show in Tampa, FL and then NYC where I will be meeting with prospective investors who are interested in seeing ICLOAK grow even faster with more resources!  NOTE:  This will not affect our obligations with Kickstarter.  All of our backers are still getting their ICLOAK Stiks from "DigiThinkIT, Inc." but the new company is necessary for our future growth.
HUGE Additions Arrive to the ICLOAK Family...
Another really big change is the fact that we have negotiated and are finalizing the acquisition of a company that will add some significant features to our ICLOAK Stik product line.  Along with the great team of engineers we will soon be announcing the new hardware which will be coming out next year.  I cannot provide more details yet until we have finals signatures which we anticipate within the next day or so.
One of the reasons for my delaying this long overdue update was because I was hoping to be able to share the details of this exciting turn of events.
We have also added another team member recently who is focused on User Experience to help make ICLOAK the best we can.
WHERE IS MY ICLOAK STIK????
Thanks for making it this far in this update when all you really wanted to know is "When are you shipping my ICLOAK Stik?"
We have come up with a partial solution to the delays that we hope you will all find very fair.  It comes in two parts... Later and Earlier:
Later...
For us to get the finished, PACKAGED, product from our manufacturing partner, Kingston, it takes them approximately 5 weeks from when we give them the "gold master" to put on the USB drives.  That means if we finish the Gold Master in the next week or two we will not be able to ship the devices until January.  If you want to get that version in your hands with the pretty packaging and all, then you will need to be patient a little while longer.
Earlier...
However, there is GOOD NEWS for those who cannot wait.  I have decided to provide a way for our backers to get their hands on ICLOAK Stik much sooner with it STILL SHIPPING IN NOVEMBER but it will come without the packaging and any additions we may be able to get done for the full production run at Kingston.  The device will ship with an updating system and you will receive FREE updates as they are available and it will be on the same drive you see in the video link below.
For details on how to choose which one you want to get we will provide a web page next week that will let you choose Earlier or Later and we will ship accordingly.
VISUAL MEDIA
I also wanted to show all of our backers what the latest version looks like so we have prepared a video which we have not finished yet.  
BUT... we are giving you a sneak peek NOW because you deserve it!  The beginning is similar to our first video but you will notice a lot more stuff if you pay close attention.  Also, please note, this is a video for the ICLOAK Stik PRO and includes applications that the ICLOAK Stik does not.
Also, there is no sound and some of the cuts are not quite right, but we are working on it and will have a much better version up soon.  So... here it is:
http://youtu.be/KWCzrNLpBH4
CONCLUSION
We are truly passionate about delivering an incredible product that will protect your Privacy when you want to.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where some people don't respect the privacy of others or even those who seek to use their ability to spy on people to steal from them and harm them.  We will keep doing our part to help.
THANK YOU - THANK YOU - THANK YOU, especially to those of you who have been patiently and silently waiting, confident that we have not forgotten about our fans and backers.  
I had a wonderful call with one of our backers who was concerned about the delays so he called our office to speak with someone.  At the end of the conversation he graciously told me, 
"Eric, thanks for taking the time to be so candid and give me an update, but now that I realize you are all doing everything you can to get this out to everyone, I feel selfish and guilty for taking even a single minute away from you working on this.  Thanks and get back to work, PLEASE!"
While he certainly didn't need to feel "selfish and guilty" for asking for an update which YOU ALL DESERVE, I was honored that he said it.
Until the next time....
In Liberty,

We have worked non-stop through this past year to prepare and deliver the W USB drive. The great news is that we have solved one of the biggest problems and are hopeful to deliver in the coming few months, with a Chinese manufacturer on board to begin in 2-3 months. Part of our problem has been to resolve a staff issue that caused a delay due to a serious illness with M Chen, our key engineer. The delay has caused some to request a refund, to which we have complied. We want to thank everyone who has grasped the vision, calculated the future returns, have stuck by us and supported us, as we go forward together to deliver the W USB drive. For those who feel they have to move on, we have extended the refund request deadline to January 15, 2016. Please send any refund request through the Kickstarter message (please do not make the request on the comment section as our staff processing refunds is only checking the message section). The main reason for the continued delay was that M. Chen, our key engineer in Beijing, was unable to continue due to contracting ebola. Our hopes and prayers go with him and his family for recovery and return to working. In the meantime, we had to close the gap his absence created. I am happy to report that we are back on track with our primary objective: completing the W USB project, as we worked with other engineers to finish what M. Chen started. Finding a replacement engineer to continue where he left off was our biggest challenge, including completing debugging the original code. We are now very close to delivering the product. We are putting all our time and focus on delivering your product and may or may not have to raise additional funds to complete the product and deliver it to market. Thank you all again. We will continue to work hard together to bring all of us a very Happy and Prosperous New Year!Update #18

Thank you for your continued support and patience. As noted in our last update, we have been debugging the camera and microphone blocker from attacks more responsively, and have finished the magnetic cap mold. Our manufacturers in China have been working to pick up the pace after the delays from government crackdowns (on VPN related products), and they are currently on track with production (the delays put us back a few months - which is why the original delivery dates have been pushed back). Again, we do apologize for all the delays in responding and delivery. We have faced problems that we were not originally able to anticipate, and we can finally see the finish line. As we wrote in our last update, our hopes are to ship all products before the holidays 2015.   
As promised, we will  provide a full refunds for those who would like one. If you would like a refund, please submit your request via personal message on Kickstarter. Please provide your email address for your PayPal or Amazon Payment, if different from your Kickstarter ID.
For those who are willing to stick it out till the end with us, we would like to offer an opportunity to receive your package for free! As an apology for the delay and as a thank you for your patience in supporting us till the end, your entire pledge would be refunded (at the time of shipment) AND you would receive your package for FREE. Again, estimated delivery is before the holidays 2015. Thank you, again, for your patience and support!Update #17

Thank you for your support and patience. We are working as fast as we can to finish the product and production for not only our Kickstarter backers but also our major international distributors. We understand some are getting impatient, and we do apologize for the delays in product fulfillment, as well as a lack of updates.
Our team is comprised mostly of programmers and designers. We do not currently have a full-time marketing team that is able to respond to comments quickly or write as many updates as we would like. The reason we are not able to respond more quickly to everyone's comments is because most of our time is spent working on the product and we check our comments section only once in a while. While that might not be an acceptable excuse for some, we honestly spend most of the day, trying our best to deliver on all our promises. 
 Since our last update, we have been successful in debugging the camera and microphone blocker from attacks more responsively, and have finished the magnetic cap mold. Our manufacturers in China have been working to pick up the pace after the delays from government crackdowns (on VPN related products), and they are currently on track with production (the delays put us back a few months - which is why the original delivery dates have been pushed back). 
 Again, we do apologize for all the delays in responding and delivery. We are not trying to pull a fast one over anyone or trying to be deceitful. We're just a group of people that believe in the product we are developing and are facing problems that we were not originally able to anticipate. As posted in the comment section, our hopes are the ship all the products by the end of the year at the latest. For those who would like a refund, we will be able to provide these when we are ready to ship out. Should our production get delayed even further, we will provide a full refund (as promised) AND also offer an opportunity to receive a FREE unit (as an apology for the delay and as a thank you for your patience in supporting us till the end).Update #16

NEW MOLD, CHINESE GOVT CRACKDOWN & DEBUGGING

Here is an overdue update. First off, we would like apologize for the delay in providing an update. Our latest update (posted at the end of March) didn't go into too many details because we thought we would be able to work everything out and only delay the shipment by a few weeks. 
For these past couple months, we have been facing a few problems that has put a delay in our release date. Here are few things that we have been working on: 
 1. Debugging the camera and microphone blocker from attacks more responsively. One of the features that many of our supporters liked was the spy-cam blocker feature. We want to make sure this function (as well as all the various features) works as well as we promised. After all, this is a privacy device and privacy is our top priority.  
2. We are finalizing the magnetic cap mold. This wasn't a part of the original product that was shown on Kickstarter. For many USB users, not losing the cap is a concern. To take care of this problem, we have decided to implement a magnetic cap mold so you don't have to worry about losing your USB cap ever again. Here is a clip of what it looks like: https://youtu.be/cY7Qt4zRl6g 
3. Our manufacturers in China have been facing delays due to government crackdowns on VPN related products (http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30982198). Thankfully, after a LOT of going back and forth with government entities, our manufacturers are finally back on track with production. 
 These various factors have put a delay in delivering our product. We would like to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Again, we want to make sure that you get everything you paid for an more. Even though we can probably send out a "Version 1" of our product to fulfill our Kickstarter campaign, we don't want to skimp on any of the promises we made to all our supporters. We have team members in China right now, making sure production is back on track and flowing smoothly. 
At this point, we are looking at a delay of a few months. We are not able to set a specific delivery date at this point because we have to assess how much of a delay the debugging and crackdown on manufacturing have caused us. We are working on providing all our supporters with more details as soon as possible. We hope that you will continue to support our company and our product!Update #15

Thank you for all your support and your patience! We're well on our way to putting the finishing touches on our product.  
While we are still aiming for the original ship dates from our campaign, there will be a slight delay in delivery due to several factors. We're working out the all the little kinks and bugs in our program and working with manufacturers to finish production and packaging. We want to make sure that you get everything that you paid for and more!

Dear our backers,
We wanna share with you the good progress we‰Ûªve made on both chassis production and voice quality improvement.
We‰Ûªve finally been able to nail down the chassis issues with the right vendor, which solves the quality discrepancy through both machine fine-tuning and manual inspections. It‰Ûªs a labor intensive process with lower production rate. But, since the initial production volume is not too high, we are able to manage it with our vendors and get the process expedited, in order to deliver the first shipment to our lovely backers who have been waiting patiently for so long.
The first batch of chassis mass production is almost done now, pending the final inspection, and will be delivered to our contract manufacturer for final assembly. Due to the holiday season, our contract manufacturer will be closed for a few days during Christmas, and we are unable to pin down the assembly schedule before Christmas. We‰Ûªve continued to work with our contract manufacturer for the schedule now, and hopefully the assembly can be done right after the Christmas/New Year holidays.
Also, we‰Ûªve made many changes in the software in order to improve voice quality. Originally, we were using Codec2 from open source for voice compression, and have spent quite an effort to optimize its performance on our DSP chip. But, due to the higher error rate of our analog modem under GSM channels, we were unable to deliver intelligible quality voice with Codec2. To address the problems, we‰Ûªve invested our time in improving our modems with error corrections, as well as voice compressions with better error resistance and lower bit rate. So far, for voice compression in the range of 300-600 bps, the only solutions we can find are commercial offerings, but not open source solutions. We‰Ûªve been testing with some of the commercial stacks, and adjusting our system software to integrate with new solutions here.
The preliminary test result is promising with the new commercial offerings, but the catch is that it‰Ûªs from US vendors with export regulation. If we were to use such commercial offerings, then we‰Ûªll have to abide by the US ‰ÛÏExport Administration Regulation‰Û, which makes JackPair subject to national security controls as identified on the ‰ÛÏCommerce Control List‰Û. This means JackPair cannot be exported the following countries, as of year 2015:
Group E1: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria
Group D1: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Georgia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Libya, Macau, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam
As the goal of JackPair is to make it universally available and affordable to everyone, we really don‰Ûªt like such a regulation imposed upon JackPair. But so far we couldn‰Ûªt find any other affordable solutions to solve the voice quality issues. In the long run, to reach the goal of JackPair as an universal solution, we would have to help improve open source solutions like Codec2 to deliver good voice quality in the low bit range of 300-600bps. Meanwhile, to avoid any further delay on the initial delivery of JackPair, we‰Ûªll probably have to bite the bullet and limit JackPair‰Ûªs availability outside those countries listed above.
Overall, the initial batch of JackPair will be assembled by the first week of January, and we are wrapping up software integration efforts for voice quality improvement. Hopefully we can have JackPair at our backer‰Ûªs hands by end of January.
Happy Holidays,

October Update: Milestones and Delay
1 Comment

Dear our backers,
It has been almost two months since our last update. In the past 2 months, we have achieved a few milestones: 
The electronic hardware is now 100% complete, with full circuit and functional tests. We have gone through a total of 6 PCB revisions to nail down the final hardware, and solved tons of manufacturing issues to get it through the production floor now. All the software components have been integrated, including voice compression, encryption, and modulations. 
Optimization and performance tuning have been done on most of them to make sure they can be run without resource constraint on our real-time embedded operating systems. 
The problem with ultrasonic welding and electroplating have been solved. Most of the tooling issues are resolved, and we are moving into the stage of pilot-run stage. There‰Ûªre still a few quality issues to be resolved for mass production.
With integrated software and hardware, we have been conducting field testing of JackPair over all kinds of mobile networks and major VoIP providers that we can get our hands on, and find and fix problems along the way. The voice quality is still shaky, and we are pinpointing the root cause and working on solutions for it. The current voice compression library we‰Ûªre using does not perform well at low bit rate bandwidth, so we‰Ûªre also testing offerings from commercial vendors to improve the voice quality. This is taking a bit longer than we thought, and may requires another 1 to 2 months before it can be fully integrated into our system.
For the chassis mass-production, we are running into quality issues with plastic inject at manufacture floor; many of the vendors cannot handle the high pressure of our toolings. Now we are negotiating with the SIXTH plant to produce the chassis for us. Yes, the SIXTH! Due to the lack of experiences on mechanical design/manufacturing, we have chosen the most difficult prototype in the chassis assembling. Also, we may have chosen the wrong partner on molding the chassis. This causes the nightmare to us. Telling the truth, the mold plant is almost crazy and regret that they take our order, and so do us. Their technical skill is not good enough to meet this kind of product. However, now we are on the same boat and no point of return. One of our teammates now sticks at the molding plant‰Ûªs office every day to get thing done.
Since the chassis needs more time, now the rest of our teammates are working on improving the quality of voice. We plan to spend more time to resolve this issue before the chassis is okay. It may take one or two more months to get the chassis since we have no idea if the sixth plant can product the right chassis for us. We are sorry and also thank for your patience. Wish no needs for us to look for the seventh.
We had been a bit optimistic and aggressive about our project planning in the past, and this has caused delays and concerns about our delivery schedule. We thought all the loose ends could be tied up by end of October for delivery, but the trial-and-error process by our chassis vendor, as well as the field test and voice quality improvement, are taking more time than we have originally planned. At this point, the majority of the project has been accomplished: the electronic hardware is completely done and mass-produced, the system software is at field testing stage, the voice quality needs improvement, and the chassis will be in pilot run soon.
JackPair is an important project for many people to communicate privately and safely, and we want to make sure the voice quality is good enough for people to count on it. It's a hard problem to solve, but we have managed to overcome most of the issues. There are still a few works ahead of us to be done for the last mile, and we will get everything done as soon as possible.

Last-Minute Mechanical Issues

Dear our backers, 
Sorry for our late update. In the past month, we really want to move JackPair into mass productions stage, and have been working very hard trying to solve the case manufacturing problems before the update. Fortunately, we have solved most of the problems. On the other hand, there are still pending issue depending on our vendors to be solved:
1. Outer case•__From the picture, we can find the flow marks on the black outer case. The mold factory had tried many ways to solve this problem but in vain. Since we can‰Ûªt keep waiting, we decide to spray-paint it. We now have placed the order to produce the outer case and it may take extra 3-4 weeks.
flow marks on the outer case
2. Ultrasonic tool•__ We have encountered problems with our Ultrasonic tool vendors. The vendor we've picked is the top brand in the industry, and we've trusted them and expected full-coverage service on the tooling, fixture, and fine-tuning of our Ultrasonic welding process for JackPair. However, at the last minutes when we're expecting the problem of enlarging the fixture to be fixed, there's an argument over the financial responsibilities of the tooling mistake. Because the vendor is 3000 miles away from us at the East coast, it'll take a few extra days for the back and forth of tools and words. It's a mistake on the vendor side, and we're sorting out the issues with them, and patiently wait for the tool & service to be deliver within the next few weeks.
Due to the problems above, we have to be conservative on the delivery schedule and postponed the shipment date to be no later than end of October. Meanwhile, before the final device can be assembled and shipped, we're putting together a demo video to illustrate the finished product. Stay tuned on this.
Thank you for your patience.Update #12

Pilot Run & Test Fixtures

Hello everyone,
As we mentioned last time, we have encountered the outer case problems. We are still working hard in solving the problems. The good news is that all the problems have been identified with solutions, but the bad news that we need more time for the fixes, and the delivery time will be delayed for another month.
During the past few weeks, we have been testing with pilot runs in our production line, and fixing problems up and down. To automate the production tests at assembly line, we have put together a home-grown test fixture to accommodate the needs of JackPair‰Ûªs hardware testing.
Image of test fixture
With the hardware test fixture and our automatic test suites software in place, we are able to identify more production issues. For example, we were able to identify the source of audio noises on some of the boards under certain circumstances. We are also conducting more functional tests to make sure the audio quality is good. This full test fixture automation allows us to test every board before it goes out of our door and into your hands.
During our pilot production run, we‰Ûªve encountered another surprise on the outer case; after electroplating, the outer case of JackPair cannot fit into the holding fixture of our Ultrasonic welding machine. We didn‰Ûªt take into consideration the increased thickness of outer case caused by its electroplating. The increased delta is only less than 0.04 millimeter, which is thinner than human hair, but yet our toolings and fixtures have such high-precision that the slightly increased delta can cause fitness problems here.
Overall, we‰Ûªre tying up all the loose end, and building up the testing framework to ensure high quality products. To make sure there‰Ûªs enough time to get everything done in the right way, we‰Ûªre moving the delivery date to end of August now. Thank you for your patience and support.

Hi GlassKaperoos!  No that doesn't work. I promise not to call you that anymore.  I hope things rae going well and thank you again for your support on the GlassKap project.  Things have been going well and people still order Glass accessories from my shapeways.com/shops/baltimore store.
I wanted to let you know that I've just launched a new Kickstarter campaign called UpLocket.  It's also a wearable technology design, but hopefully it'll reach a broader audience that just Google Glass owners.  UpLocket is an internet of things locket, a traditional locket with a modern day twist.  
Why not head over and check it out? https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/baltimore/uplocket-a-classic-accessory-with-contemporary-con Please share it, and back it if you can.  
Thanks!

Kickstarter complete! Thanks to everyone who contributed, supported, pledged, shared, and wrote about my GlassKap campaign. I couldn't have done this without you. It has been an enjoyable experience and I will certainly do it again. I‰Ûªve shipped out all of the rewards to all of my backers (except for one fella who hasn't filled out his survey yet) and am excited for the future.  
I'm happy with the way each and every GlassKap accessory turned out. It's neat to see that there are now more and more people getting Glass invites, which means more folks will be out there wearing Glass. If you‰Ûªve got any ideas for other glassKap accessories, I‰Ûªd gladly take the time to model them and make them available. Just contact me with your idea! I plan on continuing the distribution through Shapeways, and will upload all of the parts there for people to purchase that way. You'll be able to buy all of the accessories there. 
 I haven't gotten my rev 2.0 Glass yet and I think they changed the way that the glasses attach, so that might affect the opti-grab.  I'll look into that when I get mine later this week.  The macro lens will be available on my glasskap.com site only since it requires assembly.  The lenses work well but since the glass camera doesn't autofocus, it only works for a very small range.  Test it out with your fingertip and find the right distance.
 If you want, send me pics of you wearing GlassKap accessories and I‰Ûªl post them to the Facebook page! https://www.facebook.com/Glasskap
If you'd like to come see these in person, you can check out the Bmore3D 3d scanning and 3d printing popup shop I've got going on down in Baltimore!  We'll just be there for the rest of the month, but some really cool things are there.  There's the ShapeShot 3d photobooth, 3d scanning by Direct Dimensions, Ditto+ printers, lots of jewelry and other 3d prints from local artists. It's really quite cool.  We're at 2150 Boston St. In Baltimore.  I made a 3d selfie using the booth, captured while I was wearing Glass.  Check it out!  
Thanks again everyone, and if you'd like to pick up some more GlassKap accessories, check out glasskap.com (they'll be posted there soon) and my shop on Shapeways.Update #7

All of the t-shirts, GlassPacks and GlassKaps have shipped!  If you backed this project under one of those reward tiers, you'll most probably be getting them in the mail today or tomorrow!
 Still to go are the higher end reward tiers; the funpacks, the security packs, etc.  I haven't forgotten about you.  I just need to make sure i get the fit right.
I'd love to hear your feedback on the pieces once you get them.  It was pointed out to me that the hole for the glasspacks might make the piece too fragile if it's used with one of those heavy duty keyrings, so I'd suggest using the thin wire rings instead of the hard-to-pry-open rings.  Or wear them on a necklace!
I hope to see you all at Maker Faire this weekend.  I'll be at my booth, Custom 3D Stuff demoing the GlassKap accessories, and selling 3d printed jewelry.  I'll also be speaking on two 3d printing panels, 11:30 Saturday morning with Matt Griffin, Kacie Hultgren, Matt Stultz, Fred Kahl, and Tony Buser, and on my own panel at 5:00 Saturday about 3d printing and the replica movie prop community.

Hey everyone! Sorry this update is coming a little bit late; we‰Ûªve had a lot of things going on. And that‰Ûªs why we‰Ûªre writing -- to tell you all about it!
A couple weeks ago we got a call from the Plug and Play Tech Center inviting us to pitch for a chance to join their Internet of Things accelerator program. Last week we got the official word that we were accepted into the program, picked over roughly 1,000 startups who applied. We are humbled to have been accepted, and look forward to meeting industry leaders and maybe forging some strategic partnerships.
We also have a new team member, so say hello to Michal! He is working on taking all of the applications his colleagues are programming and integrating them together seamlessly. He has already hit the ground running making valuable contributions. We are excited to welcome him into the Angee family and can‰Ûªt wait to see what he does moving forward!
On the hardware side, we are constantly improving Angee and now the security tags are nearly finished! We‰Ûªve been working diligently to get them from the prototype stage to the design for manufacturing, and this past month we‰Ûªve made huge strides! Big ups to Adam and Rosta and the rest of the development team who have been busting their butts around the clock to get this done.
Since we‰Ûªre getting ready to start production, it‰Ûªs time we start thinking about packaging! As you can see in the photos below, instead of a typical box + plastic, we‰Ûªre working to design a sleek protective sleeve to deliver your Angee in style.
Please let us know in the comments which of the two designs below you prefer! (The one on the left is a bit more minimalist, while the one on the right has a band to look like your Angee.)
That‰Ûªs all for now, talk again soon!

Hi everyone! Tomas here. Just wanted to quickly give you all an update on what we‰Ûªve been up to this past month.
For starters, I‰Ûªm happy to introduce our new team members Andrew - a very solid software engineer, and Andre - our audio expert helping with signal processing and voice recognition technologies. I am very excited to be working together, welcome!
As you already know, we are in the process of finishing our final design for manufacturing, and are selecting between some of the finest manufacturers in the world to be our partner. The Year of the Monkey celebrations are wrapping up, so Rosta, George, and I are getting ready to head back to Shenzhen for final interviews.
Meanwhile we‰Ûªve made great strides in optimizing our mobile apps (iOS/Android). The features testing has been going well, and we‰Ûªre working diligently to create a UI that‰Ûªs beautiful, clean, and intuitive.
We‰Ûªre also in the process of revamping our website, which will include a store where you can buy additional security tags. Lots of you guys reached out to us saying you wanted more tags to cover all of your home‰Ûªs entry points. Ask and you shall receive :)
On that note, I woke up the other morning reflecting on a fact that fifteen hundred people is quite a lot! Our community is what drives us, and I‰Ûªd love to learn more about you, what you love most about Angee, and what you see your home looking like in the future. Tell me anything you like. We've set up an email to communicate directly with anyone who wants to get in touch, so feel free to reach out at AMA@meetangee.com.
As Angee becomes closer and closer to becoming a reality, I hope you guys realize how important your support is to us. We are not building a product, we are building an amazing company full of people who want to push the boundaries of what‰Ûªs expected from technology. And we couldn‰Ûªt do it without you.
Til next time!

Hi everyone! Tomas here. Rosta, George, and I recently returned from Shenzhen, and I just wanted to give you all a quick update on what we‰Ûªve been up to!
Looking spiffy on our factory tour :)
Tons of exciting things have been happening. First of all, the successful campaign significantly increased interest in our product and our cause. This attracted a number of really talented people, from exceptional developers to humans dedicated to expanding and interacting with our growing community. Our tempo is faster than ever, but some decisions must not be rushed. One such decision is selecting the right manufacturing partner. It's a partnership which you hope lasts a lifetime, and choosing wisely is our top priority. After interviewing almost 150 manufacturers and meeting tens of them personally in China, we are very close to understanding all the little details that will matter most on our path to make an excellent product.
Helping us make this critical decision is HWTrek (pictured above), a company which knows the local environment inside and out and is helping us navigate the process of finding the perfect partner. They have been immensely helpful and understanding, and I would like to publicly thank them. Two months after Kickstarter, we are one big step closer.
Before I sign off, I just wanted to remind everyone about the referral contest we‰Ûªre having on our Indiegogo page. Word of mouth is what drives this project, so it‰Ûªs a great way to help us reach new people. It‰Ûªs also a great way for you to win free security tags, and even free Angee units!
That‰Ûªs all for now. I‰Ûªll check in again soon. Hope you‰Ûªre all having a great start to 2016!

Hi everyone! Sorry we didn‰Ûªt get this update out sooner, things have been really busy on our end, especially as we‰Ûªre planning another trip to Shenzhen, China. More on that below. 
The Kickstarter campaign came to a close November 15th. What a ride! We finished with $531,107 from 1,512 backers -- over 200% of our goal. Thank you so much for all of your support! As you can see in the photo below, your names have taken over our office!
Thanks to you, Angee is getting ready to multiply. We can‰Ûªt wait to get her into your homes next year! And for those of you who didn‰Ûªt get a chance to order Angee, or if you want to recommend it to your friends or family, fear not! You can pre-order Angee (at a great early adopter discount) on Indiegogo.
Even when Angee was just an idea, we were fascinated by the manufacturing process. While designing the product, from the housing to the electronics, we have always kept the feasibility of manufacturing at the forefront of our mind. ‰ÛÏCan this be made at scale efficiently?‰Û was a question we asked ourselves a lot.
Once we reached our goal, we began narrowing our list of approximately 150 factories to find the right one. To shorten the list we took our first trip to Shenzhen and of course requested price quotations for production of various parts, but more importantly we discussed the manufacturing methods with a single goal in mind: making Angee special. 
Next Monday we are traveling to Shenzhen again, this time for two weeks to meet with the top engineers of a handful of factories and find the right fit for us. We‰Ûªll let you know how it goes!
We will keep you posted with monthly updates on our progress. Thanks again and talk soon!
Tomas and the Angee Team

Dear Kickstarters, 
We know you have been awaiting an update on the status of the IDKEY M. As stated in previous updates, we have been working hard to resolve certain design issues from the original myIDkey product, incorporate Sonavation‰Ûªs ultrasound sensor technology and then conduct internal trials to ensure the best possible product for our customers. We are now in the process of obtaining the required FCC certifications and governmental export approvals for encrypted devices. We will provide an update as more news becomes available. In the interim, please feel free to reach out to us via kickstarter@sonavation.com if you have any questions.

Introducing XY Share It

Hello Everyone,
Last week, we told you to be prepared for a big announcement from XY. Today, we‰Ûªre ready to let everyone know what unspeakable news it is we have been working on here at the office.
XY Share It is a simple cross-platform solution to share photos with the people around you. Taking everything we have learned in the past year and a half, we are excited to announce this completely new use of Bluetooth LE technology. Instead of texting people your photos, attaching them all to emails, friending everyone on social media, or handing your phone around the room, XY Share It allows everyone around you, or just the friends you choose, to see the photos you share on their own smart-devices. You can learn more about XY Share It on our website, www.xyshareit.com, including how you can get one for yourself. 
 Sincerely, 
 The XY Find It & XY Share It teamUpdate #39

Hey there, backers! 
 It‰Ûªs been awhile since we have updated all of you on what the XY team has been up to, and since tomorrow marks the one year anniversary of the first factory prototype landing in our office, I thought it‰Ûªd be a great time to check back in.
 In January, we were showcased at CES in Las Vegas, and since then, we‰Ûªve been running full steam ahead working on making XY Find It the best Bluetooth Finder Tag on the market. We‰Ûªve been listening to all of your feedback and have been working full time on improving every facet of XY Find It. We‰Ûªre working to make the design and interface of the app even cleaner and more user friendly. We‰Ûªre constantly improving the way we work with the beacons to make alerts as accurate as possible. We wrote an entire new algorithm for working with the map data to improve the accuracy of the ‰ÛÏlast seen‰Û feature. We reworked our firmware to improve battery life without sacrificing the beacon‰Ûªs signal strength. We‰Ûªre even looking at the hardware inside the device itself to ensure every round of XY Find It beacons is using top of the line tech. And, of course, we‰Ûªve completely reworked our backend to handle our quickly growing user-base without losing performance.
 While we‰Ûªve been putting in all this effort on the dev side, retail partners have been reaching out to us, because they recognize that we‰Ûªre the most reliable tracking tag on the market. You can now see XY Find It on the shelves of stores like Fry‰Ûªs Electronics and Brookstone, or find us online on target.com, walmart.com, and Amazon. We‰Ûªre making arrangements to be in even more stores nationwide in early 2016. 
 Thank you all for your support over the last 18 months. There is no way we could be here today without you. 
 Sincerely, 
 The XY Team 
 P.S. Keep an eye out, because we are going to share an incredibly exciting announcement coming up very soon!Update #38 For backers only.

Hi everyone, Daniel here from XY.  Since we started mass shipping XY about 3 weeks ago, roughly 80% of awards have been fulfilled with mostly multipacks including Jade remaining.  We have heard from many of you via emails, in-app feedbacks and comments here -- some of the responses were happy, some were angry, but almost all were extremely encouraging, patient and helpful. We really appreciate it.  Please keep them coming (feedbacks submitted via in-app mechanisms have been particularly helpful for debugging).
Today I want to talk to you about the top issues from the feedback we've gotten so far:
Buzzer Doesn't Work on some iPhone 6 Plus / 6
Should be resolved in the v1.3 of the XY iOS app -- already submitted the App Store and is currently awaiting approval.  It's available right now to our beta users via Apple Testflight.  Please contact us at contact@xyfindit.com if you'd like to be part of this awesome group.
Beacon Not Visible in Nearyby List / Already Claimed
About a week ago, with the help of a few resourceful backers, we discovered a major fu... flaw in our manufacturing process.  In some cases, the same beacon identifier (which should always be unique) were assigned to multiple beacons.  At the moment, we still don't have a very clear picture how this occurred.  It's apparent from the data logs that QC team at our factory did periodically reset the ID allocation program (bad!) but we don't really understand why... yet.
What is clear is the effect on the user experience.  Backers who have received one of these beacons with duplicate IDs will simply not see the beacon in their NEARBY list, or see it as already "CLAIMED" in v1.3 of the iOS & Android app.  At the moment, this is affecting roughly 7% of new beacon registrations.
Luckily, there is a solution. We designed the XY beacons for extensibility and in-field support -- the beacon firmware can be updated over-the-air via the XY app.  (Most of our competitors do not.)  We have a working firmware that fixes this issue and adds support for adjustable broadcast intervals, which can extend the already great battery life on these beacons.  We are testing the new firmware and the update process internally.  We expect to make this available to backers in our beta channels starting next week with general availability the week after.
If you think you are affected by this bug, please send us a note via the in-app feedback.  We should have a resolution for you soon.  Thanks for your patience.  More updates on this soon.
The Casing is Difficult to Open
This is a known problem.  We had to make some choices between the soft-touch of the casing material, water-resistance, and easy of opening the case.  We may have put too much emphesis on the former two at the cost of the later.  I apologize for any frustration this may have caused, and we will make adjustments to the manufacturing process for future batches.
I do want to stress that it is possible to open the beacon without damaging the case.  Per suggestions from a few of you, we have made a tutorial video:
.
Range Issues / Out of Range Alerts at Short Distances
We are still investigating this problem. The current theory is a few beacons may, for whatever reason, have very long broadcast intervals that will trigger the out-of-range alert on iOS devices.  If this is the case, the adjustable broadcast frequency in the new firmware should help... but frankly we don't know enough at this point to say for certain.  More updates to follow.
That's all for now.  As always, please keep the feedback coming and thank you for your support.

Hi there!
It‰Ûªs Andrea, Silk Labs‰Ûª Marketing and Community Manager.
We can hardly believe it, but it‰Ûªs already been a month and our campaign closes tomorrow! That means today is your last chance to snag Sense at the low price of $249! Starting tomorrow, Sense will be available for pre-order on our website, for $300.
Thank you so much for all of the community support, questions, interest, and of course to those who shared us on social. We came to Kickstarter to find our community and we couldn‰Ûªt have asked for a better one. Your feedback has offered us some fantastic ideas on how to improve Sense, and we can‰Ûªt wait for the day when developers can begin adding to the Silk platform.
Once the campaign has closed, we will continue to provide monthly updates on our Kickstarter page with information about our continued prototyping, and as we get closer to shipping, when exactly your products will be mailed out!
Stay tuned! And, as always, please spread the love on Facebook and Twitter.Update #6 For backers only.

Hi again!
It‰Ûªs Andrea, Silk Labs' Marketing and Community Manager.
Time has flown by and we officially have only ONE WEEK left of our Kickstarter campaign! That means there is only a week left to pre-order Sense for $249. Once our campaign closes, we will open up pre-orders on our website for $300. So act now to get high designed tech at our discounted Kickstarter price!
We would also like to give special thanks to Kickstarter for featuring us on the front page of their site today! Way to make a team feel special.
Don't forget we've committed to integrate Belkin WeMo, SmartThings and Insteon integration at the $200k mark. Let's try for one more push!

Hi everyone!
It‰Ûªs Andrea, Silk Labs' Marketing and Community Manager.
As we head into the weekend, we wanted to make a special announcement and share some of our new video demos and content. 
Stretch goals update
Earlier this week, we announced our first stretch goal: at $200K we will build in support for Belkin WeMo. We got a lot of positive feedback and suggestions from you and today we are upping the ante! 
We've decided to also include SmartThings and Insteon integration at the $200K mark.
We believe that including these three popular smart home platform integrations will make Sense a true asset to your connected home and hope you agree! With Sense at the middle of your connected lights, sensors, music, and more, you'll be closer to the intelligent, responsive home we all know is possible. 
Please do spread the word!

We wanted to share a fun video we made that pokes fun at connected cameras always giving false notifications. Extra credit to whoever can name the Academy Award-winning film the floating plastic bag references! :)

Reminder: Price increase after the Kickstarter campaign
Just a reminder that we will be raising the price of Sense to $300.00 after the campaign. Be sure to get in while you can!
Have a great weekend!

Hi there!
It‰Ûªs Andrea, Silk Labs' Marketing and Community Manager.
We wanted to let you know that we‰Ûªve learned a tremendous amount from your feedback these past two weeks. And we thank you for all the input! We‰Ûªve been listening and have some big news to share.
Sense at home and a sneak peek of the Sense app 
Please scope out our Kickstarter page for some new info that clarifies what you can expect from Sense right out of the box. We've laid out some amazing things that Sense can do with or without other connected devices in the home! 
Stretch goals 
We've also been mulling over your amazing ideas for stretch goals, and are announcing some exciting integrations based on what you all have been requesting. Some of you have requested support for Belkin WeMo products. So, we are announcing a stretch goal for their popular home automation line.
Our first stretch goal is.... 
At $200K we will build in support for Belkin WeMo. Have Sense make your WeMo switches more responsive and more intelligent. 
Imagine your Belkin WeMo products recognizing when you and your family members are home and reacting automatically! That's the smart home we envision. 
Stay tuned for more stretch goals including support for SmartThings and Insteon. Let's go! 
Price increase after the Kickstarter campaign
We've been working with our team in Taipei to build Sense and we have just received an update on our pricing. At the end of the campaign, we'll still have Sense available for pre-order but at the slightly higher price of $300.00. 
So if you got in on the KS campaign, great! 
If you didn't...get in now! :)
Ready, set, GO!

Meet TarDisk Pear

Last Thursday we launched TarDisk Pear in an exclusive MacWorld First Look. Shortly after we were featured in @gizmodo, @9to5Mac, @SlashGear, and more, (full press coverage below). With support and orders pouring in from around the world, we‰Ûªre proud to announce the first Hybrid Drive for MacBooks; TarDisk Pear. Unlike the TarDisks you helped us develop and ship so far, TarDisk Pear works in a completely different way. Instead of your 256GB of TarDisk storage showing up like an external drive, TarDisk Pear, pairs to your existing MacBook hardware to create a single larger Macintosh HD. 256GB becomes 512GB. 
Yes, it is that simple. Pear-ing takes a Pear enabled TarDisk and with logic combines it with your Macintosh HD. What does this mean? Simple; Your 256GB Macintosh HD becomes a 512GB Macintosh HD. 
I know what you are thinking! 
    1. How is this even possible?! Well, here is more info ;) 
    2. Can a 256GB TarDisk Pear, pear with a 128GB MacBook Air/Pro? YES.
    3. How can I Pear my TarDisk?! Great question - keep reading... 
TarDisk Pear in the Press!
We launched TarDisk pear on October 29th through an exclusive MacWorld release. Just afterwards we were featured in: Gizmodo, 9to5Mac, SlashGear, CNET ...and the coverage is still coming in! All this would not have been possible without you guys -- thank you! To show how much we appreciate your support, we're giving you the opportunity to upgrade to TarDisk Pear completely free! Yes -- Read on...
TarDisk Featured in Gizmodo on 10/28
How can I upgrade to TarDisk Pear (for FREE?!) 
We go into more depth here, about what a Pear enabled TarDisk is, but in summary it is our new line of TarDisks which have been designed, optimized and throughly vetted to run Pear :). All TarDisks we ship from our website now come Pear-enabled by default.
Because you guys were with us from the beginning, (we will not forget this) we wanted to say thanks -- We will upgrade your TarDisk for free for telling the world about Pear! All you need to do is refer just one friend! Just one. They will get ten dollars off toward their new TarDisk, and you will get Pear. Click here for both a link that you can share with your friends and details for how this will work -- thats it! Post it to FaceBook, tell your Boss, share it on an Apple forum -- hey, you could even stand in front of an Apple store and make a new friend ;)  
Want more info? All the details are here. 
Tardy TarDisk Backers AND Lost Shipments. 
Yes, we are proud to say it, you all should have your TarDisks or a tracking number that shows where it is in the mail! In fact 96% of our rewards were fulfilled by the end of August!
TarDisks are made from the best stuff on earth (Snapple borrowed the line from us)! We took an insurance policy on each and every TarDisk mailed! If you received a tracking number, but haven't received your TarDisk yet, something is probably wrong... BUT it is an easy fix to get the replacement sent out! We will need your help to fill out some forms, but we have a simple, super quick, 2-step process here. Follow the instructions, fill out the form and email it over with the necessary documents! Help is on the way! 
Believe it or not, we have a handful of backers who STILL have not completed their backer surveys! We are so excited to mail your TarDisk out -- help us help you! To our Tardy TarDisk Backers, fill out your Kickstarter survey so we can get your TarDisks mailed! If you still need help with determining which MacBook model you have, don't email us, just run this software to determine your MacBook model you need. After your survey is complete, feel free to message us through KickStarter and help us mail your TarDisk out! 
Links: Backer survey, TarDisk selector, Lost shipment.
TarDisk For Windows? 
During our original Kickstarter campaign, we received emails from windows users, requesting a TarDisk be created just for them -- so, we‰Ûªre going back to our roots to do a small experiment... We launched the TarDisk Yoga on Kickstarter, the same crowdfunding platform where we first met so many of you way back in May of 2015. Although Windows machines do not currently support Pear, their storage needs are just as real ;) 
Thanks again.
It's been a long journey together so far, and we can't thank you enough for supporting us along the way into becoming what we are today. We hope TarDisk Pear will open up a world of possibilities to a whole new category of storage products! As always we love the feedback and emails -- keep them coming!

We have some really cool new stuff to share with you! Here are some updates on our new website, our MacBook Selector software and the growth of the TarDisk team!
New Website
I think that we now have the coolest website on the planet. You need to check this out...
click here to see our new website!
Macbook Selector
Our MacBook Selector software has come a long way since we started! It‰Ûªs available on our website (and hopefully soon, via the Mac App store too!) Want a sneak peak? Check it out HERE:
Try it out!
Meet the Team
We have come a long way since March, take a look at how our team has grown! 
Pierce Schiller
Much like Gandalf, Pierce Schiller is CEO at TarDisk. Before graduating from Harvard Business School, Pierce founded a whopping four startups. He is classically trained as a bioengineer, and is our fearless leader. It‰Ûªs not uncommon to see Pierce in a white t-shirt and motorcycle glasses. In his free, time Pierce enjoys fishing and spending time in the water, but that‰Ûªs only when he‰Ûªs not cooking up new ideas for things to build. 
Kyle Horvath
Often seen at the office sporting boat shoes and a colorful collared shirt, it wouldn‰Ûªt surprise you to learn that in summers past, Kyle worked at Montauk Yacht Club as a bartender and stunt double for the Dos-Equis-Man. Kyle Horvath leads business development efforts focused on outreach and strategic planning. Kyle was generous enough to share a weird fact with us: one time a Siberian tiger peed on him, directly. When he‰Ûªs not mowing his lawn for pleasure, Kyle enjoys golf, snowboarding, and barbecuing while drinking ‰ÛÏgood ale.‰Û
Adam Rouhana
Content is king -- if you have seen TarDisk material somewhere on the net, then you know Adam Rouhana's work well! Adam was previously educated in cognitive science before taking a year to travel 17,000 miles of the globe. Most of the time, Adam is heard blasting pop-songs from the mid 90s (although he claims otherwise) and disturbing those around him with subtle in-chair-dance-moves. Other times, Adam can be found in one of the conference rooms behind the lens, pointed at a TarDisk. In his free time Adam likes taking pictures of things (other than TarDisks), exploring the world, and eating vibrant foods.
Marceau Lecomte
With Viking‰Ûªs blood running through his veins Marceau Lecomte, towers over most normal men. Marceau comes to Boston and is the latest addition to the TarDisk team. Marceau is a graduate electromechanical engineering student from Brussels. He has engaged in designing, engineering and dreaming up the future TarDisk products currently under development. From Belgium, Marceau is naturally a fan of the highest quality chocolate fineries. Interestingly, he can unicycle while juggling.
Bryan Knouse
Bryan is a ninja-level web developer. Working on contract, Bryan is often kidnapped for 2-3 days at a time where he is fed only ramen noodels and snickers bars while working 14 hours a day out of the iLab. Normally found kicking ass in Brooklyn, Bryan travels frequently to design websites for clients nationwide. Check out the kick-ass website he made for us here; TarDisk.com
Thanks again
It's been a long journey together so far, and we can't thank you enough for supporting us along the way into becoming what we are today. As always we love the feedback and emails -- keep them coming!

Shipping Update
Hello wonderful backers! The summer is now in full-swing and so are our TarDisk shipments! 
At this point, ALL MacBook Air Backers have been mailed a package and a total of 809 packages have gone out, which means about 83% of Kickstarter backers have rewards en route or have already received them!
There are two variations of rewards left to ship out. One of which is in production now (see image below) and the other of which will be in production in about 10 days. For our 17% of backers who have not yet gotten their rewards there might be a hidden benefit  --but how is ever waiting a good thing you ask!? Keep reading!
New Thumbnail Design
Over the past few months we‰Ûªve learned a lot from you. Your feedback & emails have been super helpful (keep them coming!). TarDisk is intentionally engineered for a snug, secure fit into your SD port for two reasons;  (1.) I don't ever want your TarDisk to unintentionally fall out or un-mount (2.) it makes for a more beautiful product. From an engineering perspective, it is much easier for us to make a product that is loose & sloppy rather than tight & snug. But honestly, who wants a "loose & sloppy" anything?! So to act on your feedback and to create an even better user experience, we have engineered a solution! 
After some research (i.e. re-dissection of about four different MacBooks,) we have re-designed the thumbnail removal mechanism for the P1315A (currently under production) & the R15A (soon to be under production) . The thumb-nail groove, which was previously on the side of the memory module, has now been moved to the opposite side. The re-design now allows for for a downward removal motion that pushes against the force of the internal SD port retention springs to produce a TarDisk that is easier to remove (on the rare occasion you want to take it out) and that is less prone to getting scratched!  Check it out:
Here‰Ûªs an image of the new P1315A that is now coming off the line!
There have been a couple of other slight design changes which we are happy about. For example we have further tightened the internal pocket tolerances to hold our memory modules, and we have built in a bevel into the design of the edges to help with the feel of the the card sliding in and out of your MacBook. All these changes are made while still insuring that TarDisk remains securely in the SD slot when you want it to .
Thank you for being a part of this journey! We couldn‰Ûªt have made these improvements without you.
New Instagram: TarDisk_

If you're interested in seeing all of the cool stuff going on here at TarDisk, follow our new Instagram account: TarDisk_ ! We‰Ûªll be posting frequently to document the story of our growth. In addition we are always on Twitter, Facebook, and of course  TarDisk.com.
If your friends or family are jealous of your TarDisk, let them know that they can now buy a TarDisk from our brand new Amazon page!  
As always feel free to send me an email to adam@TarDisk.com with any thoughts or feedback and stay tuned for an update on our growing team later this week.
Thanks a million!

Hey Awesome Backers,
Remember when your mom used to tell you how ‰ÛÏunique & special‰Û you were? Well let me tell you, so is your MacBook!
For those who are curious, below are the six variations of TarDisk for each of your unique and special MacBooks! You can see our attention to detail through the very small variations; such as the slightly off-center end cap (0.03 cm) of the R13A vs R13B or the 1mm difference in height between the R15A and the P13/15A. 
Precision engineering and custom construction resulted in 6 beautiful models that support every MacBook Air & Pro model since 2010. This chart also emphasizes the importance of those backer surveys you filled out for us -- thanks again for your help there! Again, our progress would not have been possible without your support!
Shipping
We‰Ûªre still shipping out MacBook Air models as they come in. Lucky backers are getting tracking numbers emailed every day. Everyone should have a tracking number within the next couple weeks. Thank you for your patience. We‰Ûªre confident you‰Ûªll love your TarDisks and excited to hear your feedback when they get there = ).
Amazon.com
For our Lucky backers who have already recieved their TarDisks, check out our new Amazon listing here! Once a TarDisk model is 100% fulfilled, we open up a retail listing on Amazon, so we can start populating the world with TarDisks! We always welcome your feedback and if you think that your TarDisk is awesome, definitely write a review here: TarDisk Amazon.
As always, thank you for your irreplaceable support, TarDisk would not be if not for you!

This week we're focusing on getting the TarDisk A13A to our MacBook Air users. "A13A" is the model designator we have assigned to TarDisks designed for a MacBook Air 13". The cool thing about our "A13A" models is that they can* be used in a MacBook Pro with a CD drive (*we will do a post about this later, it is not perfect, but it is functional!).  
Back to shipping -- Our chips have started to arrive and our first batch of Aluminum Chassis will be coming in by UPS any moment now. We are hard at work getting them out the door. We hope to have shipped all of our MacBook Airs by the end of next week. The order of shipping will be the same; 256s first, then 128s and last but never least our 64GB backers. If you don't have a tracking number yet, don't worry, you'll have one soon!
Some How-To-Videos!
Based on your super-helpful feedback, we've put together a video that demonstrates how a TarDisk can be used. At this point, we are living, breathing and dreaming TarDisks, and it is so easy for us to forget that users might have a different perspective than ours!

Bob Sopko receiving the first Everykey
We have begun shipping and we want all of you to meet the first person to receive Everykey, Bob Sopko!
It gives us great pride and joy to introduce all of you to our friend and mentor, Bob Sopko. He is the director of the Case Western Reserve University LaunchNet, an incredible organization that helps take student projects such as Everykey and bring them to life. Following the initial interest from our entrepreneurship professor in making Everykey a real business, we were introduced to Bob, and the ball really got rolling from that point onward. He assisted us in finding the necessary resources to bring the project to life including business pitch competitions to not only win money for the development of Everykey but to raise awareness. He also was influential in bringing Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak to Case Western Reserve University and provided us with the introduction to the computer legend (FYI Steve thinks Everykey is awesome too!).
Bob has been an incredible source of support and confidence in bringing this dream to life, so it is only fitting that he receive the first Everykey. Thanks Bob, we couldn‰Ûªt have done it without you!
Love,

Hello Backers,
I am very pleased to announce that tomorrow we will begin shipping Everykey! This update is something I‰Ûªve been waiting to write since the day we conceptualized Everykey in an entrepreneurship class at Case Western Reserve University.
I can‰Ûªt thank you all enough for sticking with us through the good times and the bad. It‰Ûªs been a bumpy road, to say the least. Starting this company and delivering our first product has been the most challenging thing I have done in my entire life‰Û_ but also the most rewarding. I wake up every morning excited to go to work at Everykey, because I‰Ûªm doing what I love. I feel very fortunate to be working with a group of amazing, intelligent, and dedicated people. People that are going to do great things, and shape the future of the universe. I owe you infinite amounts of gratitude Kickstarter, you‰Ûªve made this dream come to life!
Shipping Logistics
We are in the process of emailing each of you a survey through BackerKit that will allow you to confirm your shipping address and color preferences. We will begin by shipping to a small group of our backers, which allows us to verify our shipping and customer support practices. Throughout the month of April, we‰Ûªll continue to ship units and send out shipping notices via email, so you‰Ûªll know when your Everykey is on its way!
We‰Ûªve tested the Everykey user experience extensively. But as a new product, we realize that areas for improvement may crop up when four thousand people begin using the product for the first time. For this reason, Everykey will be primarily targeted towards Windows and Android operating systems when it first ships. Mac, Linux, and iOS compatibility will follow soon thereafter. We‰Ûªre launching operating system compatibility in this order as a way to focus our attention on eliminating bugs quickly. It won‰Ûªt take us long to release on each operating system and web browser highlighted in the specs section.
Thank you Kickstarter!
I know we wouldn‰Ûªt have been able to get this far without you, Kickstarter. Your support from day one is what has catapulted us from a business concept to something so much greater. We realize that it has been a long journey bringing Everykey to life, and we are grateful that all of you have been a part of it. It is only through meticulous attention to detail and endless hours of collaboration that a truly game-changing product can reach its full potential and be worthy of the label ‰ÛÏrevolutionary.‰Û
Thank you Kickstarter!

Hello Backers,

Manufacturing for the production version of Everykey is taking place and some major hurdles have been cleared. We realize that we have run into a few different issues throughout the process, however we will only be satisfied with providing a quality product that delivers the ideal user experience.
Circuit Boards Produced
In our previous manufacturing update, we mentioned that our circuit board design met the standards for large scale production. It took many versions, switching out components, and lots of hard work but 5,000 circuit boards are now ready for the final assembly process. Each and every board is currently being tested before going through the ultrasonic welding process.
5,000 Production Everykey Circuit Boards
Final Assembly
The ultrasonic welder used to join the housings is ready and we‰Ûªre fine tuning the tooling fixture that holds Everykey in place while it‰Ûªs being joined. The welder is in the Everykey production cell where final assembly will take place and our manufacturer is finalizing instructions for assembly. An Everykey engineer will inspect the operation of each system and every unit that comes off the line in addition to the testing before assembly. We intend to make sure that no units are defective upon delivery and we‰Ûªre putting significant time into ensuring full functionality of your Everykey.

Band Accessories
We are working closely with our injection molding partners to finalize the tooling for the Everykey Band Accessory. The injection molding process is an iterative one, where the exact parameters need to be dialed in using samples and empirical data. Since initiating the production of Everykey, we have faced and overcame several common issues that crop up during the manufacturing process. Last week the final mold label samples (which is the piece of the band with color) arrived at our molder. We are pleased to report that high quality, production ready samples have been produced.

Packaging Received
Everykey Packaging At Location of Final Assembly
Final packaging has arrived at our manufacturer! We want every experience with Everykey to be top notch, the final packaging serves as a testament to our attention to aesthetic detail.
Key Housings
As mentioned in our previous update, the original production housings featured a finish that did not meet our original specification. We have revised the makeup of the housings, directed our manufacturing partners and began altering the appearance of the housings. These parts will be finished around the end of this month and then moved into inventory, where final production will occur.
Fulfillment
After reviewing all of the timelines for the remaining tasks, we are projecting a March shipping date. We have made substantial progress over the last few months and many risks have been addressed or eliminated. Making a quality product is a difficult process and we realize that may be frustrating. Rest assured we are doing everything we can to deliver your Everykey. Thank you for your continued support! As always, please reach out with any questions or concerns that you may have.
Sincerely,

Happy Holidays from the entire Everykey team. As we‰Ûªre gearing up to begin shipping we want to share some details about our final manufacturing steps and fulfillment process along with some quality issues that we‰Ûªve been experiencing and the impact this will have on shipping.
Ultrasonic Welder
Our production circuit boards are designed and ready for manufacturing and we‰Ûªre focusing on the final assembly of your Everykey. The upper and lower housings will be joined together using a technique called ultrasonic welding. Ultrasonic welding requires energy from acoustic vibration to effectively melt the interface of the upper and lower housing. This process ensures that that the housings are snugly fastened so that the electronic elements are safe from water and dust. We‰Ûªve starting testing the results of the ultrasonic weld to make sure all parts are intact post- assembly.

Items for Fulfillment
We‰Ûªve started receiving all of the secondary items that go into fulfilling your orders. Last week, we received the Everykey quick start guides, packaging, and the USB to micro USB charging cables. As a team, watching the final pieces come together is such an exciting experience.
Everykey USB to micro USB Charging Cables
Quality Control and Shipping
Earlier this week, we received what were intended to be final samples of Everykey housings and Band Accessories. Unfortunately, these parts didn‰Ûªt match what we had originally specified for the final product in terms of quality and finish. We‰Ûªve been working around the clock in an effort to deliver your Everykey wristband in time for the holidays. However, the need to remake components for the wristband and key housing has become an obstacle that will not allow for holiday delivery. While we do strive for timeliness, quality is not something our team is willing to compromise. We would like to offer you our sincerest apologies and request your patience for just a little while longer. We are very close to delivering your Everykey wristband and we are aiming to ship by February 2016. Thank you again for your patience and unwavering support.

While we get close to the final assembly process, our Team continues to work tirelessly on PASSFORT's improvement. When our campaign ended, it called out attention that many of our Backers were using over 100 accounts by that time. That was why we took up the challenge to improve that aspect of the product...
We are happy to announce that your PASSFORT will have a capacity 4 times greater than what was originally advertised during our campaign, that's right, now you will be able to store up to 512 different accounts!
Manufacturing Progress
The display's Manufacturer has confirmed us that they are currently working on what we expect will be the final prototype for mass production approval. March 17th is still the expected delivery date for such samples.
Several PASSFORT's electronic circuit panels were assembled for testing and adjustment of the automated assembly process. The objectives were to identify and correct any possible manufacturing issues before we enter the mass production phase.
Several minutes later... 8 electronic circuit boards ready to go!
Once again we would like to thank you for your support, trust and patience. We will keep working to honor our commitment with you.
Sincerely,

Progress Update and Actual Status

Dear Backers,

I hope you are doing well. In this opportunity I would like to communicate important news regarding the actual status of our project.
PASSFORT has a total of 34 different components/materials. We actually have 30 of them in the Assembly Company's Warehouse.
PASSFORT's assembly components
The production circuit board panel is ready.
PCB Production Panel
The Assembly Company has already completed the setup of the SMD Automated Assembly lines. Below a couple of pictures from our recent visit to their facilities in the Santo Domingo Cyberpark Free Zone.
SMD Automated Assembly Line
We have received and approved PASSFORT's packaging prototype. Our Graphic Designers are already working on the packaging artwork, and production is expected to start in a couple of weeks.
Packaging prototypes
Regarding the rest of the materials ‰ÛÒ Delay.
To summarize the actual project's state, I have to inform you that we are experiencing a delay which will make it impossible for us to deliver PASSFORT on the originally estimated date of March.
Even though PASSFORT uses an off-the-shelve LCD display, it's Touch Sensor ‰ÛÒ Cover Lens assembly is a custom made component. During the design phase we chose this component from an actual smartwatch model made by a Chinese manufacturer.
PASSFORT's screen assembly
What happened was that when closing our negotiations with said manufacturer (about 5 months after our initial business), when we sent our Buying Agent in China to visit their factory, we realized they were almost in bankruptcy.
Smartwatches Factory Visit
To guarantee quality and supply we decided to switch to a different supplier. We immediately contacted one of the spare manufacturers we previously identified for such cases and visited their Shenzhen factory. After confirming they could meet our needs, we hired them to make the LCD ‰ÛÒ Touch Sensor ‰ÛÒ Cover Lens assembly.
Shenzhen's Display Manufacturer visit
However, given this was a custom made component, sample's manufacturing process and its final arrival to our offices took 32 days.
Left: Previous Part. Right: New Part.
After receiving and testing the samples, even though we got them to work, we found some manufacturing issues that needed to be addressed before final production. The Manufacturer assured us they could be fixed, but gave us an additional two weeks before they can send us the final samples for approval.
Given the shape and dimensions of the Screen assembly directly influences PASSFORT's enclosure, as soon as we were conscious of this situation, we were forced to put the mold manufacturing on hold until we were certain that this issue was resolved. 
Chinese New Year
Chinese celebrate their New Year with holidays that extend from February 7th to Feb 14th. However, most factories close from January 30th to give their workers a chance to travel to their home town and families for the celebrations. In practical terms, production levels aren't restored to normal up to the end of the third week of February.
According to our updated project schedule, it won't be until March 17th when we will have in our hands the Screen assembly's final prototype to be able to give a green light to its production. Afterwards, its production will take about 40 days to reach the Assembly Company. Likewise, it won't be until March 29 when we will finally receive the Plastic Mold injected samples of the enclosure. This one must also be approved before final production. 
Finally, the programming, testing, final assembly and packaging of PASSFORT will take about four weeks to complete. Once ready, the whole production will be imported from the United States with a transit time of about 10 days. After the corresponding customs clearance, it will be delivered to a Logistics company which will be in charge of sending the individual rewards through the US Postal Service. Depending on your country of residence, it might take between one to three weeks before it actually reach your hands. All of this means that the estimated delivery date is now July. 
I would like to conclude by thanking you for your patience, and asking your forgiveness because of the troubles this situation might cause you. At Xolutronic we greatly value the trust and support you gave us to make PASSFORT a reality. We are committed to make Your Digital Life Secure, and we won't rest until we honor our commitment with you. 
Sincerely, 
Emil Rodriguez

And some App news.
It's no secret that you, our very first supporters, put us on the map and proved that there is a market for our platform.  Due in large part to that, we're very proud to announce that we will be closing a $3 Million dollar round of financing with some wonderful new partners by the end of the month!
To read more about it click here.  There's even a Kickstarter shout out in the article!  As you can imagine, this funding will allow us to expand our current team, create new business opportunities and enable us to continue the work that you helped us get started.
In other news, we've had some great developments on the app side of things, both Apple and Android!  For you Apple users, we've listened to your feedback and we've released our second update.  Improvements include a way for you to customize how your Wearsafe Tag will send alerts (one press, three or more presses, or a long press). To enable this feature, simply go to the More section and choose "activator settings".  We also fixed a small issue relating to different timezones and birthdates. * Plus some stability fixes and behind the scenes improvements.
And last but not least, for you Android users...check this out.
As you can see, we're getting closer on the Android version of Wearsafe so the light at the end of that tunnel is getting brighter!
Have a safe and enjoyable holiday season!

We're closing in on our year-end deadline and the pieces are finally coming together.
The t-shirts are ready, our new application server is deployed, and we're ready to start taking your userids for the system.  Backers at those levels will get a questionnaire from kickstarter to collect shipping addresses and info.
In case you missed it, we delivered on our commitment to a free and open source platform a few weeks ago, which you can get here: https://github.com/TrsstProject/trsst 
It's fully functional with a command-line client for posting signed and/or encrypted messages, and pushing and pulling feeds between participating trsst servers.
We've made some revisions in response to feedback and we feel like the format and protocol is settling down nicely.  We will continue to develop our platform in the open.
As we mentioned earlier, we are still a few weeks behind schedule on the front-end, but we continue to work furiously during this holiday break to catch up. 
Once your ids are registered, we look forward to you being able to begin posting, and we will also use our platform to keep you posted for future development updates (to which of course anyone can subscribe with their feed reader of choice!).
Thanks again so much for your support of the project.

Project Update # 28: About LMO5000

Dear Kickstarter Backers,  
Good day and thank you for your continued support. 
Back in March, with our update #27 about LMO5000, we requested for time to focus on a better battery back up design. Except for couple of backers, almost all backers confirmed their desire to wait for a better design. LMO5000 back up battery design is in progress with our battery vendor. Present battery life/test is not acceptable to our rigorous standards yet.
While we sincerely appreciate your indulgence and patience to wait for a better design, in order to avoid inconvenience for our LMO5000 group, I would like to re-iterate on the information that I shared back on March 25th.
1.   We will refund your payment in full, for LMO 5000 order. As soon as a new design is approved, you will be notified, and you may order the product at the same discounted price. Or,
2.   Instead of a LMO5000, we will replace it with one or two units of LMO3000 (as you wish). If any balance is available, it can be refunded immediately, or can be applied towards other new products that we will be announcing in the immediate future. Or,
3.   Receive 50% discount on all LogMeOnce software products; LogMeOnce Password Manager (Professional / Ultimate editions), and future products we will announce soon until equivalent Dollar amount for LMO5000 is reached.
While we have made considerable investments on LMO5000, I am confident that you would agree and prefer to receive a fully functional product rather than a design that is not approved by our QA team. Please identify your desired option, and respond via private message, so that we can process your request accordingly.
I do appreciate your continued support and patience, and please accept my apologies for any inconvenience or infrequency in our communication. Thank you, and please stay tuned for our next announcements.
Sincerely,

Hello everyone, 
LMO5000 is going through additional testing. One of the components in the back up battery needs to have a better performance. Although ‰ÛÏbattery life‰Û is at an acceptable level, it is not acceptable to our rigorous standards. To avoid any delays, while we are perfecting the battery aspect of LMO5000, here are the following options we would like to offer to our backers, 
1.  Please indulge us and wait, until our new battery component completes its design and production. We are awaiting delivery date form battery manufacturer, which may be pushed back until October. Or, 
2.  We will refund your payment in full, for LMO 5000 order. Or, 
3.  Instead of a LMO5000, we will replace it with two units, one of each LMO3000, and LMO4000 and will ship within a week.

Please identify your desired option, and respond via private message, so that we can process your request accordingly. 
Additionally, all of our Kickstarter backers will receive our comprehensive mobile Password management software suite ‰ÛÏFree‰Û of charge. Thank you for your continued support.

Help us test Mineservers

We have for some time had three Mineservers and three Mineserver Pros running in a rack in the Sonic.net data center here in Santa Rosa, CA. The Ethernet problem we mentioned in a previous update persists: the eth0 interface sometimes spontaneously disappears or hangs while loading on a reboot. We have been working continuously on this problem and at this point are beginning to think it's somehow data center-related. By this we mean that the problem down at the data center doesn't occur in similar Mineservers running at our home on Castle Rock or at Clinton Collins' place in Dripping Springs, TX. These run without problem. And since we don't know of any Kickstarter backers who live in data centers we've decided to just charge ahead with the beta test.
We need your help. Here are the six test Mineservers and their associated IP addresses. Try playing on them first with the hostnames. That will test our Dynamic DNS service. If there's a problem with the hostnames THEN use the IP addresses.
mineserver1.mineserver.com (198.27.153.226)
mineserver2.mineserver.com (198.27.153.227)
mineserver3.mineserver.com (198.27.153.228)
mineserver4.mineserver.com (198.27.153.229)
mineserver5.mineserver.com (198.27.153.230)
mineserver6.mineserver.com (198.27.153.231)
We are initially testing three different Minecraft multiuser servers -- Vanilla, Spigot, and Cuberite. We have a Mineserver and a Mineserver Pro running each so there are six different experiences. Please try them all. We won't identify which type of server hardware or software you are playing to avoid bias in your reviews.
Please post your experiences as comments right here. Tell us which server you were playing and how it went. Feel free to compare different servers saying which one was better or worse. If there was a bug or some failure (we've seen them) please describe what happened. This will help us catch bugs and tune the performance of both hardware and software. 
Given that backers are all over the world and these six servers are all in California, please also say where you are playing from so we'll get a sense of how distance affects performance. Most players on these boxes once they ship will be in the same city but you never know... 
There may be times when the server you want to try isn't available. That will be because we have it down for maintenance or that darned Ethernet bug is back. If that happens please just move on to another server. Most of them should be available most of the time.
And please keep coming back because we'll be changing things every day trying to improve your Minecraft experience. This beta test will last no more than two weeks.
Thanks for your patience and for your help.Update #15

Sorry to have gone so long without an update. We won't do THAT again.
Here's what's new. The best Minecraft server of all in our opinion is Cuberite, which is also the only one written in C++ instead of Java. Cuberite extracts far more performance from our hardware than any other server, which is why we chose to make it our de facto installation. We‰Ûªll also support Vanilla, Spigot and Tekkit Lite (you can switch between them), but Cuberite will be the first server to compile on the machine.
The only problem with Cuberite is that the off-the-shelf admin application we discovered doesn‰Ûªt support it. Or didn‰Ûªt. The very cooperative admin developer in the UK is extending his product to support Cuberite. This should be done soon and waiting for Cuberite is a major reason why we haven‰Ûªt shipped. We‰Ûªre hoping to have it in a few more days.
But waiting for Cuberite wasn‰Ûªt our only problem. We had to develop a dynamic DNS system, WiFi support, and make sure the units were totally reliable.
Oh, and our laser cutter burst into flames (again).
Understand that for a Mineserver or Mineserver Pro, the sysadmin also typically goes by another title ‰ÛÓ Mom. Our administration tool allows her to control the server from any Internet-connected computer including Android and iOS mobile phones. She can bump or ban players from the frozen food aisle, monitor in-game text chat, reboot the server ‰ÛÓ anything. It‰Ûªs a very powerful and easy-to-use tool.
While we were waiting for Cuberite support we've added something else for Mom to worry about, a Mumble server. Mumble is open source voice chat with very low latency. We were able to add Mumble to Mineserver because the CPU load is very low with all encoding and decoding done in the client and the server acting mainly as a VoIP switch. If she wants to, Mama can listen to the Mumble feed and step-in if little Johnny drops an F-bomb.
Every Mineserver has its own individual name chosen by the customer. This server name, rather than an IP address, is how whitelisted players find the game. Consulting with dynamic DNS experts prior to the Kickstarter campaign this sounded easy to do with a combination of DNS A records and SRV records. But it‰Ûªs not so easy because Mom doesn‰Ûªt want to have to do port forwarding, so that meant adding other techniques like Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which is tough to do if it‰Ûªs not turned-on in your router. We eventually developed what the boys believe is a 95 percent solution. In 95 percent of cases it should work right out of the box with the remaining five percent falling on the slim shoulders of some Cringely kid.
Every Mineserver is assembled by a specific child who is also responsible for product support. His e-mail address is right on the case and if something doesn‰Ûªt work he can ssh, telnet, or VNC into the box to fix it.
But still there were problems, specifically WiFi.
WiFi was something we‰Ûªd rather not do at all, but it has become the new Ethernet (even Ethernet inventor Bob Metcalfe pretends WiFi is Ethernet, which it isn‰Ûªt but we still love Bob). Many home networks are entirely WiFi. We feel the best way to use a Mineserver even in WiFi-only homes is by plugging the included CAT6 cable into a router or access point port and using the router‰Ûªs WiFi capability. But some customers don‰Ûªt want to plug anything into anything, so we‰Ûªve included native WiFi support in some Mineservers and all Mineserver Pros. That sounds easier to do than it actually was.
Mineservers are headless so how do you set an SSID or password the first time? Good question, but one we finally solved. Mineservers can now be configured and administered entirely without wires if needed. In most situations the customer will plug-in their Mineserver to power and it will just work. If it doesn‰Ûªt, then an 11 year-old will fix it. That first power-up will involve downloading and compiling the selected server software, which can be changed at any time. It‰Ûªs a process that takes 5-10 minutes and then you are up and running.
What we hope is our final technical problem has been particularly vexing. We now have three Mineservers and three Mineserver Pros running at the sonic.net data center here in Santa Rosa. All six servers plus a power strip and a gig-Ethernet switch fit on a one foot square piece of plywood. The truly great folks at Sonic gave us half a rack and we fill perhaps one percent of that, meaning you could probably put 1200 Mineservers in a full rack ‰ÛÓ enough to support up to 60,000 players. But operating in this highly-secure facility with its ultra-clean power and unlimited bandwidth we began to notice during testing that sometimes the servers would just disappear from the net. One minute the IP would be there and the next minute it would be gone.
We‰Ûªre still waiting for Cuberite support of course, but we even if we had that today we still wouldn‰Ûªt ship a product that disappears from the net. We‰Ûªve tried swapping-out boards but the problem still occurs. Maybe it was the gig-Ethernet switch, so we got a new one, then a bigger one, then an even bigger managed switch. We changed cables. We started fiddling with the software. Each Mineserver board has a serial port so we converted an old Mac Mini to Linux, added a powered USB hub and six UART-to-USB adapters so now our consultant in Texas can use six virtual serial terminals to monitor the test Mineservers 24/7 without having to rely on their Ethernet connections. Everything is being logged so the next time one goes down we‰Ûªll know exactly what‰Ûªs happening.
Things are getting busy in here (16-port switch, USB hub, Ubuntu Mac Mini plus six UARTS)
We‰Ûªre also in touch with other users of the same board like Lockheed Martin and Lawrence Livermore Lab where they have a cluster of 160. But that‰Ûªs nothing compared to three kids in Santa Rosa who are right now burning-in 500 boards.
It‰Ûªs the final bug, we‰Ûªre approaching it with planning, gusto, and plenty of Captain Crunch, and fully expect to solve this last issue and start shipping next week when the kids are off school for Spring Break.Update #14

Mineservers and cases awaiting SD cards
First an apology. We're sorry to have taken so long to post this update. We know people have been expecting their Mineservers and are upset with us. We'll be more transparent in future.
One problem in doing updates in the face of seemingly relentless bad news is you really, really want to be able to say at least one thing that's positive and that has been difficult for us. But we believe the tide has now turned and we are moving forward with gusto toward shipping your Mineservers.
More Mineservers
In our last update we explained that in early December we lost our Linux consultant who simply dropped off the face of the Earth. Despite many further attempts, we have yet to hear from him or about his fate. We were able to eventually replace the guy, but our new consultant was busy with Christmas and then the New Year and finally didn't feel up to the peculiar technical challenge we faced.
You see the admin application we licensed from a very fine developer in the UK wouldn't compile on our ARM hardware. We're sure it could eventually be made to compile but the developer had a new release to work on and there was another way to make the application work using Mono -- open source middleware for running .NET applications on non-Windows systems. Our second Linux consultant had tried and failed to get Mono running on our Mineserver boards.
More cases
At that point we decided it was better to learn about this stuff than to hire and bring up-to-speed more consultants. So we studied Arch Linux, studied Mono, and lined-up the help of Xamarin, the San Francisco-based company behind the Mono Project. Fortunately we were able to succeed where our consultant had failed and Xamarin's help has (so far) not been needed. We thank them, though, for their quick response and willingness to assist.
Now we have Arch Linux updated and tuned for our two boards with Mono running as well as AMP, our licensed admin interface.  Two software challenges remain: 1) getting WiFi working on the base Mineserver (it already works well on the Mineserver Pro), and; 2) tuning and testing the Minecraft multiuser server software supported on our boxes.
WiFi cases (they are different)
This latter task is simple but time consuming because it turns out there are eleven(!!!) Minecraft multiuser servers that are broadly used. Ten of these were already in the AMP list and we are adding our favorite, Cuberite.
Lots of servers to choose from (plus Cuberite)!
Over the next 7-10 days we'll be testing like crazy all eleven servers. And to do this we need your help. We are building a test rig with 11 identical servers (one.mineserver.com, two.mineserver.com, three.mineserver.com, etc.). Given that these computers are each the size of an Altoids tin, the Mineservers plus all 11 plus power supplies and a gig-Ethernet switch will fit in about half of a 1U rack drawer down at our ISP in town. We'll issue another update when the servers are ready and ask you to play the heck out of them. We'll use the server logs to change settings until everything is ideal, test some more, then burn the SD and eMMC cards. 
Please wait for that Kickstarter update and login info because the servers aren't yet at our ISP.
Maybe a quarter of the server settings!
As for the hardware itself, well as you can see that's all done -- 425 units burned-in and ready to go. But we can't install the boards and put the lids on until the software is finalized and the SD cards (now eMMC cards in the case of Mineserver Pros) are installed. In both cases the cards go on the bottom of the circuit board so the cards have to be loaded before the boards are installed and the cases glued shut. Yes, glued shut. 
The software can be updated online but we want to ship a 1.0 version we know works well right out of the box ('er envelope). 
Thanks for your support.  Update #13

We're sorry to say that our shipping schedule has been pushed back a few days yet again. The parts are all here. The cases are built (pictured is a WiFi Mineserver‰ã¢ with laser cut acrylic case). The admin software arrived from England and even the Chinese clock batteries are finally in stock. But our key Linux consultant has disappeared.
Every tech startup uses consultants for this and that because we can't afford to hire anyone full time and many key tasks take only a few hours or days. That was certainly our situation with Linux. We needed to choose the best distribution for our project, port it to our target boards, then integrate the admin interface and dynamic DNS service. For the first two of these tasks our consultant choice was ideal. But then, just as we needed him again for the final push, he disappeared. No e-mail responses, no returned phone calls. He's a thousand miles away so we couldn't just pop over, though maybe we should have.
Denial plays are huge role in every startup. Sometimes it is a good thing: if we didn't deny to ourselves how difficult these things are to do we'd never even try. But sometimes the denial goes on too long and that's the case here. When our consultant -- a guy who stayed with us to do the original Linux port -- stopped replying we thought he was just really busy with something else. But last week when the admin software arrived from Bristol we really needed him and he wasn't there.
So we looked for a new consultant, which is a difficult thing to do this time of year. Finding consultants takes time as does bringing them up to speed. Our last guy was a Minecraft server expert and there aren't very many of those around. Fortunately we've found someone new through our board supplier and though he isn't so familiar with Minecraft he's very familiar with our hardware because he works with it every day. So what should have been two days of work will probably take three or four and of course there's this huge holiday happening so we've probably added a week to our schedule. We're sorry but it couldn't be helped. There's no way we could see this coming.
As for the old consultant we wish him well and only hope that nothing terrible has happened in his life. Things happen. Life gets in the way sometimes. And the pressure of startups is such that sometimes technical people just have to pull back. 
Bob Metcalfe talks about the early days of 3Com when they were trying to finish development of the world's first commercial Ethernet adapter and a key engineer became distracted with measuring the acoustic reflectivity of his office cube ceiling. The best thing the company could do, Metcalfe decided, was to help him with the measurement. So they put all the resources of the company into helping the engineer get back to his real job that much sooner. We only wish we'd had such an opportunity.
Again, we're sorry, but shipping will be delayed about one week.Update #12

Boy with 100 Mineservers
That's Fallon, age 9, standing in front of a table covered with 100 Mineservers‰ã¢. These units are waiting only for their real-time clock batteries, a thousand of which left China by FedEx on Friday headed our way. All of these Mineservers‰ã¢ will ship this week. All Mineserver‰ã¢ and Mineserver Pro‰ã¢ boards are here on the shelf for assembly, cases are built or parts are sitting on the bench to be assembled into cases. Software is complete and SD cards are being duplicated. T-shirts are being printed every night by small boys. We'll have product shots in this space tomorrow (Tuesday) and hopefully burned-in Mineservers‰ã¢ will begin moving on Wednesday to the Post Office. All cases for both models will be finished by Friday and all pledge levels will be fully honored by seven days after that (a week from Friday).
Thanks for your patience.

ImageTech appreciates the support and patience of all backers. It is understandable that everyone wants to receive their reward to use printers from their mobile devices ‰ÛÏWherever You Are‰Û! Our focus has been to provide a quality and reliable product from its initial release. printWiFi and printUSB are intended to solve printing challenges not create new ones. So while all our backers are supporting new product development, few if any would want rewards shipped before the product is fully functional and reliable.
Unfortunately, there have been several challenges late in the development process which, delayed the release. For example Apple‰Ûªs new iOS 8.X changed the file access/privilege process and required additional development. Apple‰Ûªs increased security for approved USB chargers and USB accessories required additional development. Inconsistencies in the way Android mobile devices implement USB communications required additional development. 

Good news! These challenges have been resolved, software is in final testing and the product is in manufacturing. We want to share our excitement with the progress as depicted in the images below of product in manufacturing.
Again, everyone at ImageTech sincerely appreciates all our backers' pledges. It is our first priority to reward you with a printWiFi or printUSB to enable mobile device printing ‰ÛÏWherever You Are‰Û!!

Yes that's right. All rewards have shipped.
Today the last few international rewards were mailed out. Sadly there's no way for me to be able to judge the time it may take to get to you, I've had a package get from the US to Germany in a week while another one take two months. So if you are a non-US backer and you have not received your reward in a few weeks, please contact me so I can give you the Customs Package Number. Depending on how your country handles international mail, you may or may not be able to get status of the package from your postal service.

RPi rev 0c update. After doing some research with the Arch Arm Developers and contacting Broadcom, it seems that there was a hardware change on the rev 0c RPi units which does not allow for USB booting. There is no way around aroud this via software, so I will be creating a special version specifically for those with rev 0c units. Please be advised that the performance hit from running off the SD card completely will be fairly substantial. I would recommend at some point getting a newer RPi so you can take advantage of the performance increase running off the USB gives.  

For those of you that have had booting issues, please boot another distro on your RPi and do a cat /proc/cpuinfo to see what hardware CPU revision you have. If you have a failure to boot, you will need to do an MD5 sum on the media to see if there is a problem there. All the images and MD5 hashes have been uploaded to my personal server and will be transfered over to SourceForge within the next week or so.Update #18

Just a quick update to address the questions we've gotten recently.  We've gotten some reports from the people who have received their Raspberry Pi rewards of some incompatibilities with the rev 000e RPi units, we are testing to try to determine the solution for these.  All of the BBB rewards should be shipping this coming weekend.  Also the Odroid3 units should ship the following weekend.

Big Changes and Backer Rewards
0 Comments

Hey Everyone,
We've had some really big changes over the past few weeks. Here's what we've been up to:
(1) Some big front-end changes - we've made PunkSPIDER much easier for you to use and much clearer on what data we have in the system. We've also improved our filtering greatly, and made the overall user experience better for you.
(2) PunkSCAN v1.3.0, a new super-efficient version of PunkSCAN is about to be released. It's many many many times faster than our 1.2.x versions, and we're proud to continue to keep it free and open source for everyone.
(3) We've scaled our Hadoop cluster up. It's over TWICE the size it was when we first started. This is awesome, and means we get you more results, faster.
and last but not least...
(4) Backer rewards are up! See our first contributor of the week and other contributors on our "Contributors" page.
Thanks to everyone for continuing to support our project! It's going great and we couldn't have done it without you!

PunkSPIDER New Front End and More!
0 Comments
Like
Hey PunkSPIDER fans!
This past week we made some big improvements to PunkSPIDER, thanks to you all! Here's what we've done for you non-techy PunkSPIDER fans:
(1) The front-end is now way friendlier for non-technical folks. In particular, we've color-coded everything and added an "overall risk" field to your search results. So, if you're not familiar with the vulnerabilities we're checking for (XSS, SQLi, BSQLi) and you just want quick information on how safe a site is, you can just check this field and see if the site you're visiting is secure.
We recommend avoiding sites with an overall risk of greater than 2 and be very wary of sites with even a risk of 1. In general, if you see anything other than full-on green when searching for a site, be very very wary and consider an alternative website for your needs.
If you're a website owner and you see any issues, contact us, we're glad to help!
(2) The front-end is a lot prettier and friendlier. Our first front-end was a quick way to access our data on the back-end, but the new front-end is focused on being a little bit more usable and friendly. Check it out for yourself at http://punkspider.hyperiongray.com
For you techies and security researchers out there:
(1) Our scanner has been improved. In particular, the false positive rate for our BSQLi scanner has been improved. You can check out our code changes by downloading our code, or if you have any specific questions, let me know!
(2) We've improved our search filters. You can now make the filters non-additive (you can search for sites with SQLi or BSQLi or XSS in one query).
(3) Our API has been improved, and we're getting ready to release official documentation on it on confluence.
For everyone:
(1) We're getting ready to scale up our cluster. That means faster results for everyone.
(2) We are starting a blog that will have a little something for everyone. We've added a link to it on the site, we'll have content up soon!
(3) Last but not least, PunkSPIDER will remain 100% open and free for everyone!
Stay tuned for more updates and thank you all for all of your support!Update #2

Just five days before the Kickstarter for RECAP S2 is over! Very exciting. 
Rewards updates:
added a $55 pledge level and have RECAP C as a reward. That's the RECAP model that let you record into an iOS/Android device (model S2 records to a PC/voice recorder)
added a $60 pledge level and have RECAP S2 as a reward. I thought adding this pledge level would help some last minute backers to support the project.
Survey results:
Thanks to everyone that answered the 30 seconds survey! If you have not yet submitted it, click here Your answers are always very helpful to me. Remember, I only created RECAP S2 and C because of the feedback that I received from backers!!!

For the folks who enjoy the "how it's made" of projects, here's a couple snapshots showing the of the fabrication of the RECAP enclosures. 
3d printer and stack of RECAP enclosures
 The RECAP enclosure is made of two parts, a "box" and a "lid". A batch of 10 boxes takes about 1 hour and 35 minutes to print; a batch of 10 lids takes about 39min.  
So in total, the printing time per full enclosure is 12 minutes. After printing each case needs to be prepared and only then receive the circuit board and get sealed.

Dear Beloved Backers!
There is a lot to be thankful for this week! First and foremost -- your TarDisks are freshly assembled, look fantastic, and are ready to ship out to your door. We have been hard at work these past few weeks getting your orders prepared for a timely shipment and they're 100% ready!
 In order to get your rewards out to you in the quickest way possible, we have created the easiest reward redemption system we could think of. 
You will "order" your Windows TarDisk directly through our website (http://bit.ly/1YDuLbr) using your uniquely generated discount code -- each code will correspond to your KickStarter order information and will result in an order of $0 on our website. Your code will be sent to your KickStarter inbox shortly. At that point all you will need to do is enter your shipping information. This way you can take advantage of our TarDisk fulfillment processing which is fully implemented. 
Step 1) Visit: http://bit.ly/1YDuLbr - The Product Page for TarDisk Windows 
Step 2) Select your size -- 128GB or 256GB based on your reward class.  Click "Add to Cart" (not Buy Now), then click "checkout."
Step 3) At check out, enter your coupon code. Each Coupon code is uniquely generated to match your order!
Step 4) Enter shipping information.
That's it! The sooner you place your order the sooner we can get your rewards out to you! It usually takes us 1-2 days to processes and ship orders.
 Expect your Unique Coupon code to arrive in your KickStarter Inbox later today!
As always, Like, Follow, and Share the good news on Facebook and Instagram :)
All the Best,

Hello Awesome Backers! 
We did it! 
Over the next couple of days we will start ramping up production! Depending on how long it takes KickStarter to forward over the funds (it took 10 days last time), we will send out backer surveys and set the process in motion of fulfilling your orders! There will be another email with logistics over the next few days, but for the most part we will do the heavy lifting! 
Excited to ship out your New TarDisks! 
Thanks for all your help and support -- it is because of YOU that we are able to do this!

Funding ACHIEVED!
Hello Awesome Backers! We can't thank you enough for your support. By backing us you're enabling the creation of the first ever 16mm long storage module created specifically for windows computers! Together we're bringing this idea to reality. 
Timing of Shipments
The campaign ends in less than a week! And we promised all shipments mailed by December 1st. As the second campaign we have run, we are seasoned veterans at this! No Delayed shipment -- all orders will be we manufactured, packaged, and shipped on schedule!
Stretch Goals
If we hit $7,500 we will ship you a free USB to SDXC converter with every 16mm TarDisk! 
If we hit $50,000 we will set each of you up with a dedicated cloud storage account backing up your personal TarDisk and your entire computer!
If we hit $100,000 we will give you the ULTIMATE upgrade. All $50 pledge level pledges will be upgraded to 128GB and all $100 pledge levels will be upgraded to 256GB! (Please note, this level will delay shipments into sometime in the spring as we will need to renegotiate contracts to be able to afford to do this) This will be the ultimate upgrade and we would be so excited to do it!
THANK YOU
Thank you again for your support, without you we would not be here today. If you have any ideas for stretch goals, projects, or anything else that you'd like us to consider, send them our way!

Roomswap Update!
0 Comments
Like
1 like
Hey everyone! So it's been about 8 weeks now and I wanted to give you all a quick update! In between holding almost all A's this semester and working on Roomswap's new mobile platform (and swaps!) things have been quite busy. Progression is incremental but it's happening. I can't wait for you all to see the finished product in February 2016! 
So here's what Roomswap has been up to in the last 8 weeks:
1. Roomswap has saved students $8,924!
The students I have worked with in the last 8 weeks have ranged from first-generation college students working two jobs AND graduating (yes!) to students taking opportunities at The White House for the Fall semester. These are my favorite students to work with because they are a prime example of why Roomswap is needed on every college campus. This accomplishment alone makes the kickstarter, the hard work, and the late nights in between studying extremely worth it.
2. Roomswap has increased its present at University of Oklahoma
In the last few weeks, Roomswap has been presented to our student segments on multiple occasions. First, I tabled at the OU IAC International Bazaar, where I spoke to international students about finding housing through Roomswap this summer. Second, I attended an OU OATS Transfer Event, where I spoke to current transfers about Roomswap's new mobile platform, and got their input on what they are looking for in a housing service. Lastly, I attended a mentorship dinner where I had the opportunity to meet an OU Alumnus, he is now connecting me with an entire network of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who may want to invest in Roomswap.
3. Roomswap is on its way to University of Texas
This weekend, I am mentoring at the UT Macomb School of Business Startup Simulation. I will be guiding students through a weekend of entrepreneurship and innovation! This will be a great opportunity to present Roomswap and also hand out more flyers on the UT campus. I'm really antsy to start doing actual swaps at UT. I plan to use this weekend to learn more about UT's off-campus housing/the general area.
4. Development is coming along
The homepage for the new mobile site is set, and the profiles are about 75% done at the moment. Development is coming along, though it's taking longer than expected (which I was told would happen). The tentative plan is the launch in February 2016.
The last few weeks have been very exciting! Not much of the kickstarter money has been spent yet (as the company has made money too), but we're super excited to begin a few campaigns that will showcase Roomswap and its ability to support university students everywhere.
If you have any questions or comments feel free to email me at carey@roomswap.coUpdate #4

"Why $5,000?" Roomswap's Plan/Cost Outline
0 Comments
Like
HOW ROOMSWAP BEGAN
Roomswap began in November 2013 as a small lease takeover service at the University of Oklahoma. Since then, we've saved students $24,000 in rent they otherwise would have had to pay to their apartment complex/landlord.
For the last (almost) 2 years, Roomswap has been bootstrapped; all of the money earned has been reinvested into improving the business. The company has also been run manually - with housing matches being done by hand.
The next logical step for us is to become an actual tech startup with a mobile platform. So that we can expand nationally in the way that we've envisioned for almost a year now.
But there are steps that must be taken on our journey to tech startup-dom, with funding from friends and family being the most important (and first) stepping stone.
WHY KICKSTARTER?
Support from friends and family is important in the success of any startup. It shows potential investors that those around the founder believe in the mission so much that they are willing to help fund the startup to ensure it's success.
WHAT ABOUT INVESTORS? 
Well that's the next step. After this campaign, we plan to reach our to friends and family who wish to invest in Roomswap's future for equity. Our list will be hand-picked, with friends/mentors/backers of course holding first priority. 
This can only happen though if we first receive funding on Kickstarter. 
After receiving funding from family and friends, we will begin conversations with angel investors who have reached out to us and will also begin scouting for more who believe in our mission. They will also be the first 3rd party to value our company.
After a few funding rounds with angel investors, we will begin chatting with Venture Capitalists who will also valuate Roomswap and give us enough funding to grow the company substantially. 
WHAT IS THE $5,000 FOR?
After extensive market research at the University of Texas, we have decided that launching at UT is our next logical step. Although our new mobile platform will not be ready until December 2016, we do have a lower-grade version on our current website that has proven to work well (www.roomswap.co). We plan to launch in September at UT with our current site, with hopes that we can begin working with students and developing partnerships before before our huge launch in December. 
Costs associated with our expansion include:
1. Hiring two campus ambassadors ($1200)
2. Bi-monthly promotional items for campus ambassadors ($2000)
Signs for tabling
Tank tops
Flyers
Other promo swag for students
Fees for startup events 
3.  Operating costs
 $39 per month for our online database ($195 total)
 $144 for website renewal (www.roomswap.co)
 $600 for additional marketing at OU
We expect the development of the mobile platform to have quite a few costs, with about $350 being the maxiumum. It could be higher or lower depending on what bumps in the road come up.
3. Development Costs ($300)
Buying web/cloud space
Other unexpected development costs
We expect the remaining money to go toward our backers and their rewards/shipping.Update #3

"Why is Roomswap Needed on College Campuses?"
0 Comments
Like
2 likes
If you look at any college town, you will see dozens of apartment complexes owned by 4-6 parent companies. These companies offer students 10-13 leases that not only upcharge students but raise rent almost academic year.
So what happens when a student graduates? Or studies abroad? I can tell you - they end up stuck in a housing lease that has the potential to cost them (and their parents) thousands of dollars.
With Roomswap, university students can take back their power in a manipulative housing market by offering their space on our platform at a lower rent that competes with the market price offered by the complex they are living in; making their space more attractive to a student in need of housing.
At Roomswap, we want students to skip out on shady real estate agent or apartment complex whose only concern is the bottom line, and instead utilize their own campus community.
Below is Founder Carey J Flack's 6 minute presentation at 1 Million Cups OKC, it begins at :58. We hope this video will give you a better understanding of Roomswap and why it's so crucial on college campuses around the nation.Update #2

Backers Getting UpKits, MURKAGON Pin File Correction, and First Sightings!

Hi everyone,
The Monsters are teleporting. We've had our first sightings on Instagram. Below are prints from @Keebie81 and @ClumsyBlastersPix. Thanks to Kirby for discovering our MURKAGON pin file mistake.
First, we have two updates for you:
Backers will receive a Monster UpKit this year to make up for the price difference between the KS and the website.
You might have noticed that the Monsters are for sale on the website for less than you all paid for them. We really struggled with this decision. We didn't feel like the price point was where it needed to be for enough supporters to buy them - mostly because they're pretty big models and use a decent amount of filament. So we brought the prices to $49.95 for all three and $19.95 for individual Monsters. 
We also don't feel good about leaving you all paying more. After all, you made them possible and had faith in the concept when it was just an illustration and a story. So, to make up the difference, we plan to develop an UpKit sometime this year and send it to you all. The UpKit will go on the site for everyone to purchase after you get your .STL files. We hope this feels right to you. We definitely want to do the right thing. 
MURKAGON pin file correction - check your inboxes if you got MURKAGON.
As early adopters, we appreciate you letting us know what you love about the models and what we might have botched! After we released the files, we realized that there was an error in the MURKAGON pin file. We've fixed that, and today we're going to re-send download links for the Monster Set and MURKAGON individual model. You can replace the original files that you received with the new files. We're sorry for the mistake :/ and we hope you have fun battling MURKAGON!
As always, the links will expire 24 hours after we send them, so be sure to download your files to your computer right away.

 Hello Backers, 
"T-Day" is here and we feel THRILLED, EXCITED, HAPPY! 
The Monsters are on their way to your inboxes. They will come to you from the 3DKitbash PayLoadz account into the email account you linked to Kickstarter. The links expire 24 hours after they're sent, so be sure to click on the links, download, and save the files to your computer right away.
Thank you for defending Earth from DOOM! Once you 3D print your Monsters, post your pics/video on social media using #QuinSaga @3DKitbash #3DKitbash so we'll be sure to find you!
Post your pics or videos by March 31 to enter the #QuinSaga Monster Battle! See www.3DKitbash.com/monsters for details.
Development has been an awesome and challenging process of discovery. Through it, we've been able to create these quality, support-free, articulated models that will deliver the most enjoyable 3D printing experience possible. Thanks to your backing, we figured out new ways to connect articulated parts, make models reliably scalable, and you've helped us add sinister antagonists to the #QuinSaga universe of characters. Every good plot needs evil antagonists (and adorable pets), don't you think?
We can't wait to see your pictures and to put these on the site for everyone to buy and make! They'll be available at www.3DKitbash.com/monsters within a week.
Thanks again, everyone. All our best,

Hi everybody,
We wanted to let you all know that all three monsters are in test print and tweak mode. 
Quincy discovered some joint improvements while developing TONPINK and MURKAGON. So he's going back and applying those things to the GANKRA sculpt. Mainly, they make the head and tail joints more snug.
Quincy also made a couple of changes to MURKAGON's tail as well, and is re-test-printing that guy. 
We'll likely achieve 3DK print quality standards for all three monsters tomorrow (Sunday evening), we'll take photos utilizing the day light on Monday. Then we'll be ready to put the .STL files together and send them to backers.
When the pics are ready, we'll send surveys to backers who get to choose your one or two monsters.
We're getting excited for the big reveal. Thank you, everyone, for helping 3DKitbash bring these premium, fun-to-print, designs to the world! We hope these monsters are among the coolest things you print in 2016 in terms of engineering, design, and story. We can't wait to see how you customize yours, and we can't wait to see your #QuinSaga battle pics and videos!

Shipping status update

Hi everyone, I just wanted to give a quick update on the shipping status of Piper so you will have an idea of when you will actually receive your Piper.
Now that I've shipped the first few units, I know the rate at which I can build them, which is about 2 units per business day, more on the weekends.  Some days I will complete more than 2, but I work full time as a web developer so I can only promise that I can complete 2 every work day.
Given that there are about 20 orders and I'm using 2-day shipping, I am confident that you will receive your Piper by the 16th of August at the very latest.  
I will try and get the other rewards like the postcard and 5 paper wallets done this weekend.
Thanks for your support!Update #2

Hey everyone!  We'd like to thank you very much for being awesome and backing Piper.  We couldn't do it without your support!
We've been working hard recently to finalize the software that Piper will run, and I'm proud to tell you about some of the features of the application that will run when you plug Piper into a TV/monitor and mouse/keyboard.  The application brings new features to Piper that some of you have been requesting, such as the ability to print an encrypted private key and print many wallets at once (bulk wallets).  
Electrum users rejoice!  We've added Electrum integration with Piper.  Meaning, we added menu items to Electrum to print your keys from it, or print your Electrum wallet seed.  So if you want, you can forgo using the Piper application and use Electrum instead.  This lends itself to a lot of cool things, like offline transactions with your Electrum master public key.  If you're interested, check this out (specifically the section labeled "How to make offline transactions using your Master Public Key"): http://electrum.org/tutorials.html#offline-mpk
We'll be pretty busy over the weekend assembling and testing as many Pipers as we can.  We will be shipping everyday as we build the units, and we promise to keep you updated on when your specific unit ships.  
Thanks again for your support!  Update #1

Hi everyone, everything for Piper is coming along quite well and according to schedule.  
First, the good news
Today we received some new paper with a 10 year image life, and our test prints appear to be good so far.  To be specific, we now have rolls of appleton paper of grade 400-2.1.  You can see the different paper grades on this chart: http://www.appletonideas.com/Appleton/jsps/pdf/thermal/Storage%20and%20Shelf%20Life.pdf?0912
We are open to obtaining even higher grades with a longer image life, but we can't seem to find a source of it in the 2.25" wide x 50' long format or the 2.25" wide x 55' long format.  We've used our best google-fu but the best we can find is the 400-2.1 grade paper.  So if you can find a higher grade, we will buy it and ship it with Piper!  Please let us know if you find anything!  We'll give you free stuff in return :)
Second, the better news
Our enclosure manufacturer has just shipped our enclosure order, and according to the tracking number it's scheduled to arrive 5 days earlier than we had planned.  So you might just get your Piper a bit earlier than you expected :)  No guarantees though!
Third, we need your help!
We're finalizing the software and we need to know what you want Piper to include.  Piper is running on Debian (Raspbian specifically) Linux, so any Linux packages that you want, any Python libraries or development environments that you guys want, let me know.  I set up a quick forum to use for Piper which is located here: https://piperwallet.com/forum so please post your responses there.  
We currently have vanitygen and a local copy of bitaddress.org on Piper, and we're looking to add electrum as well.  The current Piper install uses about 2GB and we put 4GB SD cards in Piper, so we have 2GB free to use for more software.
Thank you everyone for your support so far!  I'm so excited to get Piper into your hands so you can start doing cool things with it.

We've set up a store site to sell the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield. If you need or want more, you can buy all of the sets that were offered as rewards here on our Kickstarter, plus you can buy the expansion as a standalone kit or bare board.
Prices are the same as the rewards were in the Kickstarter. The only difference is International shipping. I had to add on a bit more to better cover actual International shipping costs.

Thanks to everyone who supported our Kickstarter! We hope you get good use from it. According to the shipping tracking, just about all have been delivered by now.
We do have more inventory to sell, if you want additional universal proto boards. We haven't set up e-commerce yet, so your orders need to come through email and PayPal at "duanebenson@yahoo.com"
The prices are the same as listed here on the Kickstarter. If you're outside of the USA and want more than one set, send an email to my PayPay email first, at "duanebenson@yahoo.com"
Again, thank you very much.Update #10 For backers only.

The second edition is DONE!

I completed work on the second edition of Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons this weekend! It's a whopping 32% longer than the first edition (now 325 pages)!
I haven't done the Kindle version yet, and I'm not sure when that will get done. So for the time being, the only way to get the digital copy is through my KickStarter campaign which ENDS IN 24 HOURS! If you haven't backed the campaign for the second edition and want a digital copy, now is the time to get in!

Second chance for second edition

My first attempt at a campaign for pre-sales of the second edition didn't make it, but it still did pretty well. I have re-launched that campaign with a lower target and I expect to hit that target easily. This campaign is only a week long, so if you missed out last time, now is your chance!

My KS campaign for the second edition of Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons has 36 hours left to go, but it's a long way from the goal line...
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/careyparker/firewalls-still-dont-stop-dragons
The campaign for pre-sales ends tomorrow night (Monday)! Would you like an updated and expanded version? Maybe you'd like to upgrade to a hard copy this time? Maybe you know of someone else that could really benefit from this book? Or perhaps you'd like to give the book as a gift! NOW IS THE TIME!
I'm about 90% done with the manuscript and plan to be complete by next Monday (8 days). The second edition will be at least 20% longer than the first edition - with more pictures, lots of updated information and better formatting!
So it's not a matter of if or when I'll update this book - it's about trying to raise funds via this pre-sale so that I can do a formal book launch. I've got a professional PR person lined up and a plan in place which includes getting a guest spot on a prominent podcast and perhaps even a radio show. I've already decided that I will be putting in at least $500 of my own money, no matter what happens, but to really do it right I'll need about triple that. There's only so much I can do myself - I need to hire a professional. And that's the purpose of the KS campaign!
Thanks everyone!Update #49

I've posted a new KickStarter campaign for the second edition of Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons! If you're interested in getting the updated and expanded version, this is basically a pre-sale of the second edition.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/careyparker/firewalls-still-dont-stop-dragons
If you have any helpful feedback on the first edition (things you'd like to see in the second edition), please let me know - I want to continually improve this book to make it as informative and useful as possible!
Thanks again for supporting me the first time around! Don't feel obligated to chip in again - but if you know you'll want to get an updated copy, then by all means use this method to get one of the first press runs!
Thank you!

Aloha.   First, with 24 hours to go, I want to once again, Thank You personally for your support. :)
  And with a manageable number of backers, your order fulfillment should be very fast. So when the USB are loaded with Web Armory and in the Mail to you, I'll send you notice and tracking-if its available for your mailing area.
 At that time, you'll also receive your own personal password for WebArmory.org download page. This is for you to access all the downloads and files-just in case you decide to format the Encrypted USB or want to make copies, etc.
Lastly, you'll also get my personal e-mail, to contact me anytime you have problems, advice, suggestions, for this version or whatever. :)
  Once again... Thanks for your support!  :)Update #4

Web Armory on a USB...

   Thanks once again for the support.    I know it was a short run- only 14 days.   But I never like dragging things out forever!  So I'm happy with the small number of backers; because this will allow me to make an extremely quick turnaround, and get the Web Armory USB get out to you guys and gals, ASAP. :)
   So you know. Another cool benefit of having the Web Armory on a USB, is that if you do ‰ÛÏwander‰Û into the dark corners of the internet and some bad servers- with badly written browser vulnerabilities, tries to embed its exploits into your computer. The simple act of having the browsers located on a USB, and not loaded/running in the ‰ÛÏappropriate‰Û Windows C-Drive File system, is sometimes enough to confuse the malware and even prevent specific malware from attaching or launching correctly. SWEET. :)
 But Seriously... Thanks again and help spread the word(but not too much-lol) in the final days. 
Mahalo, for your support. :)Update #3

Digital Fingerprints...

    One of the cool things Web Armory does, is "Digital Fingerprint confusion" technique-which no one has ever done like this before(!). The reason Web Armory tries multiple ways to confuse your 'digital fingerprint', is because it's another way you can be tracked or even hacked online. This information shows hackers, how to hack your system-by showing what programs, software, etc. are installed on your computer. So the less info you give them, the better!!! 
   The two browsers below: the top is my friends my laptop's & the bottom is the same laptop computer-with Web Armory installed. See the difference... :)
 Want to see how much, your current internet browser is telling the World about you? Just go to https://panopticlick.eff.org and see for yourself.  Hit the "Test Me" button.
  Thanks again for your support. :)

Simplesafeapp is finally in a live BETA with simplesafeapp.com
The main sponsor list is included. The PHP coding is basically done. AJAX requests PHP for an answer, and one receives the answer quickly. I decided not to include the "copy password" option in case it gets misused for security reasons (however, I'm still thinking about it).
I'm about to start working on the chrome extension for this app and on the design for the android application.

The rewards have been given for that particular part. I'm still in process of building the website; however, the application is still in beta, but updated to work normally now (though lacking many features).
http://simplesafeapp.com/
I'm currently writing out the secondary and primary sponsor list for the main page of simplesafeapp.com.
the site will be up and operational within the next 7 days. I hope everyone's ready for it.
I'll be releasing updates to SimpleSafeApp for android continuously until i reach a stable release version. I'll release the code and the rewards for the backers when that happens. Until then, you can download the beta version and start using it!Update #10 For backers only.

An extra step to security
0 Comments

I was reading an article earlier and found out that my password idea has some weaknesses. I never knew of "rainbow" tables and by creating this application, I want to encourage users to use SIMPLE words and phrases, which aids to the use of rainbow tables.
For those in the unknown, rainbow tables are tables that have a serious of hashes (like MD5) for commonly used dictionary words in passwords etc. 
Basically, I'm patching that exploit up in several ways. :)
Hopefully, that will add some extra security. HOWEVER, that means that all of the MD5 hashed passwords will drastically change. Luckily, the app is not up and running because if it was, this little realization would create a load of trouble.
