As Seen On
The Problem
If you live in a house, or even a multi-room apartment, you know how annoying it is trying to control the blinds on every window.
You wake up in a dark room and have to use an artificial light before letting the sun in by opening the blinds in the bedroom. You come home from work to a hot house because the sun was warming it all day. Now, you have to adjust the thermostat to cool it down. You have to close the blinds before turning on your TV or computer. It drives you crazy on vacations away from home, wondering if you left any blinds open. At the same time, by having your blinds closed for several days in a row, you are giving a signal to burglars that the house is unoccupied and offers a ‰ÛÏwindow of opportunity.‰Û
Hi, my name is Eric. As an electrical engineer and software developer, I am very excited about the opportunities offered by the Internet of Things. But also, I‰Ûªve been really unsatisfied with the level of fragmentation and complexity in the industry. Almost every new device requires a separate app or a new bridge. Home automation is supposed to make our lives easier. Instead, just to turn on a light, you need to find your smartphone, open an app, wait until it is connected to the bridge, and only after that, turn on the light. The complexity slows down smart home adaption and prevents many of us from using the fruits of the technological progress.
I wanted to have a product which would work right out of the box, ‰ÛÏtalk‰Û to other appliances, and would be easy to install and manage with just a touch of a button. I visited my local Home Depot and searched online. But all the solutions currently available on the market are either very expensive or too complicated (or both).
So I had to come up with my own device.
Meet iBlinds
The iBlinds kit is made for homeowners and landlords who would like to save time and money on energy bills and to have an automated solution which makes their lives more comfortable and secure. It is designed for the busy lifestyle of contemporary people but will also be hugely appreciated by your elderly parents and people with a limited mobility by protecting them from unnecessary, dangerous ‰ÛÏgymnastics.‰Û
iBlinds is an easy to install and manage control kit for your blinds. It will let you automate any two inch horizontal blinds in your house or office: set up a specific time to open and close, adjust them to keep your home warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, manually control a single blind, or a group of them, from anywhere in the house or in the world, using a free app on your smartphone.
Imagine how much easier it will be to wake up with gentle sunlight coming through the blinds as they slowly open in the morning. You will feel more positive and productive during the whole day!
Think about all the time you save by automating all the blinds in your house.
Enjoy saving money on your energy bills. With iBlinds, you will find yourself using your air conditioner less frequently. Letting natural light in, you will not need to turn your lights on every time you come home or wake up.
The more windows you have, the more you will benefit from iBlinds.
If you are a landlord, iBlinds will make your life less stressful:
No need to go to each house or apartment to open and close the blinds.
Save money on energy bills by controlling heat coming in and out of the house. Lower your heating/cooling expenses.
Attract more renters by offering them a level of comfort available in luxury properties.

How It Works
  iBlinds kit with $20 Solar Panel Add-On
An intelligent blind motor, a Z-Wave device designed for tilting Venetian (two inch slatted-style) blinds. A free Z-Wave App will allow you to open and close the blinds and to use the value slider for precise positioning of the tilt angle.  
Special adapters for all tilt rod sizes and a height adapter for normal profile headrails. By default, it will fit a low profile headrail.
A lithium rechargeable battery for a long and extended life, simple to charge using USB adapter or a solar panel.
A power cable and USB Charger
A Solar Panel (add-on to iBlinds Kit) an environmentally friendly and worry free method for charging the rechargeable battery. This eliminates the need to connect the USB adapter and charger cable.
Z-Wave
Z-Wave Compatible Systems
iBlinds uses the Z-Wave protocol to integrate with your existing home automation network right out of the box.
Z-Wave is a wireless technology that makes regular household products, like lights, door locks, window blinds, and thermostats ‰ÛÏsmart.‰Û Z-Wave products ‰ÛÏtalk‰Û to each other wirelessly and securely and can be controlled by a single app on your phone, tablet, or Z-Wave remote.
Z-Wave currently includes more than 1,200 interoperable products, allowing you to create custom solutions by mixing and matching your smart devices. Synchronize activities into scenes to control multiple products with a touch of one button.
For example, after setting a geo fence on your phone, you don‰Ûªt need to worry about turning off your lights, closing blinds on every window, locking the doors, and turning on your security system. Your Z-Wave network will do everything for you.
Z-Wave Mesh Network

Z-Wave hub can control up to 232 devices. Creating a mesh network, every device extends and strengthens the range of communication, bridging the gap between smart appliances located too far apart.

The iBlind device is designed to function like a Z-Wave light dimmer.  
iBlinds will work with all iOS and Android devices.
Installation: No Worries
iBlinds are easy to install. You don‰Ûªt need to call a contractor, buy special tools, or survive a messy remodeling project. Use your existing blinds, just make them smart.

Behind the Scenes 
Meet the Neobase, the world‰Ûªs first Private Network Device.
We wanted to enjoy all of the things we love about social networks while shifting the balance of control and privacy back to users. That‰Ûªs why we created the Neobase - the world‰Ûªs first Private Network Device.
The Neobase is an encrypted device that lets you create a private social network that only you control. Sharing with friends and family is easy, and you decide exactly what you share and who you share it with. The unique cloudless design of your Neobase and network means that all of the posts, comments, web links, photos and files you share are stored on your Neobase, and never pass through any web site, service or cloud.
Beautiful. Simple. Affordable. 
Three words you never hear when talking about privacy. Until Now.
While the Neobase is designed from the ground up to address security and privacy concerns when sharing on the Internet, it's comfortable for anyone who's used a social network.  
An important difference is that you decide exactly who to share with each time you post.
You and the people you share with always know who‰Ûªs in on the conversation.
Your post can contain more than just photos, videos, and web links, including any number or type of files such as music or documents. Your photos, videos, music and files are also automatically put into collections, making it easy to organize and share.
The Neobase is so simple to install and use that it‰Ûªs easy to forget there‰Ûªs powerful technology at work that completely bypasses central web sites, servers and cloud servers. This means that no one - not even us here at Neone - can know anything about you, your activities or what you share. Neone doesn't host or operate your social network - you do.
You can add up to five family and friends as additional users to your own Neobase. You can optionally connect with other Neobase owners and users in the Neone Network.
Mobile
It‰Ûªs hard to maintain your privacy when you‰Ûªre on the move, especially when connecting over open public Wi-Fi networks. No matter where you are or how you‰Ûªre connected, the Neobase mobile app uses a fully encrypted connection directly to your Neobase. Capture and share photos and videos when the moment is right, knowing they‰Ûªll never be stored on an unknown cloud service.
There‰Ûªs no such thing as privacy on a social network. Together, we‰Ûªre going to fix that.
At Neone, we use the same social networks you do, including Facebook. We enjoy posting and sharing links and pictures with our friends and seeing how many likes we get. So, just like you, we‰Ûªll keep on using Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter for the things we want a lot of people to see. The problem is sharing the things we want only with the people we want to see them.
In the news and through our own experiences, we've learned about privacy issues on social networks.

Even if nothing serious has happened to you, we'll bet you've had some annoying or uneasy feelings on a social network like Facebook. Maybe it‰Ûªs a comment on your post from someone you don‰Ûªt know. Perhaps your boss friended you and you couldn‰Ûªt say no. Maybe you forgot that picture you posted back in college. It could be that you posted a photo of a visit to your hometown, then every person you know there wants to know why you didn‰Ûªt visit them.
We use different social networks for different things, like Instagram for photos, LinkedIn for business, Twitter to engage our followers, NextDoor in our neighborhoods, or Basecamp for projects at work. We want you to use the Neobase as a special social network for a really important purpose - privately sharing your most intimate thoughts, moments and images directly with the people you know, love and trust.
Here‰Ûªs what people are saying about the Neobase
Just a few of the great things people told us after using the the Neobase:
Security and privacy as a product architecture, not an afterthought
When you decide to share, your Neobase connects directly to the other Neobases used by the friends you‰Ûªre sharing with, delivering only the posts, comments and other content you have indicated. Your activities and comments never get stored on or pass through any central web sites, servers and cloud servers.

The decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture of the Neone Network is a fundamental change in how your activities and information are stored and shared on the Internet, making it the heart of the Neobase‰Ûªs security and privacy.
We've added additional security technology and encryption throughout the Neobase.  Your computer or mobile device uses a secure SSH tunnel to connect to your Neobase and the Neone Network, which is much more secure than a browser with SSL. We use industrial strength secure encryption keys that only you have access to, rather than easily stolen usernames and passwords. No one stores or has access to your credentials other than you, including us at Neone. 
While there is no such thing as a perfectly secure and private system, the Neobase significantly and fundamentally reduces your risks and puts you in control of your activities and information. There's just no comparison between the Neobase and "private social networks" stored in the cloud, or social networks that have privacy "settings" and "features."

Our founder and leadership team share the story of how a great concept became an innovative product.

  Product Development Details and Timeline
We‰Ûªre proud of our progress. We‰Ûªre on our third generation prototype, which is nearly production ready and is the result of top-notch engineering and exhaustive testing in the lab and in homes. 
We know that a lot of crowdfunded hardware projects deliver their units to backers many months after the estimated date. We‰Ûªve backed and have been frustrated by those. We‰Ûªre confident we won‰Ûªt fall into that group, and that we‰Ûªll deliver your Neobases by the estimated date of August 2015.

We‰Ûªll use the funds we raise on Kickstarter to build additional software features and to establish large scale manufacturing operations for our hardware. We hope you'll back us, and become an important part of our vision to turn the concept of a social network upside down, shifting the balance of ownership, control and privacy back to users.
Jotgram ‰ÛÒ location-based messaging.
A modern, fast location-based messaging service with user-friendly feedback and privacy features. Free to use anonymously or as registered user. Have something to say, praise or rant at a specific location? Then Jotgram is for you!
Jotgram idea.
Jotgram is written by a small team of young web developers and privacy advocates, based in Atlanta, GA. We believe the world needs a better location-based free speech expression (anonymous or not) whether it is ‰ÛÏgood‰Û, ‰ÛÏbad‰Û or ‰ÛÏjust saying‰Û with no corporate or government oversight or censorship. This is real-time short messaging, controlled only by the author or user‰Ûªs feedback and tied to a specific location (#rather #than #a #subject, #person #or #business). The best part ‰Û_ no registration is required!
The current messaging services and social networks base their businesses on controlling data and communication flow, and often censoring our thoughts and opinions by suspending accounts. Aren‰Ûªt you tired of not owning your own pics, creative work and communications? They‰Ûªve shown over and over that they not only refuse to protect their users‰Ûª privacy, but have also admitted to feed their users‰Ûª information to both private and federal snoops. So, if we want to take control of our communications, if we want privacy as an option, we have to do it ourselves.
Jotgram is intended to be a completely independent web-based platform, not only independent from corporate and government oversight, but also independent of a mobile platform as well, such as iOS or Android. This is the only way to give complete control back to the users. Jotgram is designed for speed and vast amounts of location-based short-messages. It is flexible and scalable and has support for strong privacy options built in from the very start.
We plan to have Free and Premium Services. Any user can post Jotgram for free at their current location. With Premium Service  users will be able to post Jotgrams at any location as long as it has street address. The Premium Service is intended to help small and medium size businesses to promote their product & services at the desired local markets.
We need your support to make it a reality!

Why we need Kickstarter, and You!
Building a web service is good‰Û_but building something with motivated individuals, partners, and a global team is much better.
We started to build the site and made good progress but we quickly saw a broader application for Jotgram ‰ÛÒ we could take a big bite out of the top social networks and other communication platforms. We knew that if it was going to be successful it would take more than just a small team and our life savings. So we need you guys to help us all get there. With your help we'll make it a movement, not just a website. 
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to fund a three-man team for 6 months of full time work on Jotgram resulting in our first stable version in December 2013. Our beta version will deliver the following properties:
‰Û¢ A modern, elegant, easy to use location-based communication medium.
‰Û¢ An intuitive, user interface that is fun to use.
‰Û¢ Fast and efficient mapping algorithms.
‰Û¢ A very fast, scalable search engine.
We also have stretch goals for future development, if we raise extra money:
‰Û¢ Internationalization support, so Jotgram can speak your language.
‰Û¢ Build iPhone app and Android version of Jotgram.
Following our beta release, we will spend another 3 months debugging, fleshing out features, responding to user feedback and getting the user interface translated to languages other than English. Our goal is to have a final release ready in March of 2014. The project already exists and you can check out what we've done so far at Jotgram.com 
Who are we?
The Jotgram core development team consists of three people: Igor Kozlovski, Oleg Blidchenko and Vitaliy Artyukh.
Igor is responsible for the UX and user interface design & development and is the overall lead for the project. He has an Engineering degree and has been in consulting management positions at two of the big 4 accounting firms for over 15 years. Generating ideas and creating new things is my hobby.
Oleg thrives on solving challenging interface design problems. He has a Master‰Ûªs degree in Computer Science and, for the past 7 years, he has worked for large, multi-national companies.
Vitaliy is our core backend developer, database and security expert. He has spent the last 4 years working as the PHP and database developer and HTML5, JS, JQuery and Ajax coder.
We are all passionate about building user friendly, efficient consumer oriented services. We all have a great deal of experience working with the web and local social networks, and we know how important communication free of obstacles is.
Jotgram Community
Members of the Jotgram Community (contributing $55 or more) get to have input in the long term direction of the project. To this end, we will set up a forum dedicated to this conversation. After all, you are the ones funding the work and your voices should be heard.
No censorship, no spying. Just powerful location-based messaging service backed by a community of people who care. 
Jotgram's Impact
At the very least, this project will create a cool new communication medium which will help communities be in the know about local events, problems, achievements, sales, etc. etc. However, if successful, we hope to accomplish something far more important: circumvent Big Brother and fight for online privacy and freedom of speech.
By making a secure communication available, we hope to be a platform for candid feedback providers everywhere. Finally, even if only a fraction of the general public switch away from the proprietary short-messaging providers, it will put pressure on these big corporations to take more care and respect the privacy of their users. Competition is good for everyone.

Did you know that all of the emails you're sending and receiving aren't secure? They can be accessed without your knowledge ... anytime! So we developed SAMS (Secure Authenticated Mail Service), the simplest way to encrypt your emails. Just install SAMS and continue using your current email solution and address. SAMS works in the background, securing your communication with other SAMS users. There's no central security system or back door to SAMS so you can't be hacked. And each user holds the digital key on their approved devices so only those devices can decrypt the email messages. Finally, your emails are private and secure.
Product Demo:
Product Screenshot
The view on the left is your inbox on your device with SAMS installed. The view on the right is what anyone trying to access your email, as you can see the Subject and Email contents are encrypted, therefore useless to hackers or people spying on your email.  
Product Video Overview
PLAY

Who can use SAMS?
SAMS is meant for everyone. Privacy is a critical topic and affects every person using electronic communication today. Every day the news has articles about hackers, governments and groups attempting to get your personal information and data. 
Our goal is to restore your peace of mind. If your email account or email data is accessed without your permission, the data within the email that was sent through SAMS would be useless, as only you have the digital key on your approved devices to unlock it.
Privacy in the news, SAMS would have protected our users: 
Russian Hackers steal 1.2B passwords, 500M email addresses
Google Under Fire for Data-Mining Student Email Messages
Data Breach: Yahoo email account passwords stolen
British Spy Agencies Assert Power to Intercept Web Traffic
The NSA and You: Spying on innocents
NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say 
About SAMS:
We need your help to bring SAMS to everyone. SAMS (Secure Authenticated Mail Service) is a new breed of security and privacy protection for your email. Simply install and configure SAMS and immediately begin securing your communication from your current email accounts with other SAMS users. 
 SAMS is a breakthrough in the following ways:
SAMS installed on your computer means you can start sending your emails ‰ÛÏencrypted‰Û to other people using SAMS. This means you can now send emails with confidence knowing your emails are protected, private, and can only be read by the intended recipient. 
A strong focus on positive user experience. SAMS is effortless to install and use. 
SAMS is a stand-alone application and runs in the background. SAMS does not change your email address or how you use email today. 
SAMS is unique because it provides maximum security and authentication like no other email service or product available today. 
SAMS provides peace of mind. Today, emails are sent unsecurely through the internet, wide-open and can be accessed without your permission or knowledge. With SAMS, only you have the digital key to unlock and view emails on your approved devices.  
Tell me about the Security:
1. Use your existing email address
You don‰Ûªt need to change the way you send emails to be protected, keep using your existing Yahoo, Gmail, webmail or company email service. SAMS will automatically encrypt email for you when you send to other SAMS users. Since SAMS is email-system agnostic, you can send emails to anyone globally and as long as they have SAMS your emails will be protected.
2. Point to Point Encryption
Emails are encrypted by the SAMS client prior to leaving your device and decrypted by SAMS once received on the recipient‰Ûªs device. The encrypted emails whether stored on any server or traveling through the internet can only be decrypted using the local key on your approved devices. Server administrators, hackers and spying nations do not have your unique key so they cannot decrypt the messages in your account, keeping your emails safe. SAMS dynamic encryption ensures that even if the same data is sent billions of times, the encrypted data will be different each time.
3. User Keys  
User keys are unique and held locally on your approved devices. There is no server with privileged access or privileged information that can break the system, therefore no back door. There is no way to grant access to your data without your consent.
SAMS allows the cryptographic keys to be exchanged dynamically, with great frequency, effectively creating variable public and private keys. The keys are composed of two parts, one fixed and the other variable. The fixed component has the email address and a number of other identifiers of the owner. The variable part is modified frequently, making it impossible to obtain the private key. The two parts together form the complete public key used within SAMS.  
4. Cryptography  
Our new methodology allows the use of multiple symmetric and asymmetric cryptographies (AES, RSA, PGP) to be used together in an interlaced mode. This makes it extremely difficult to gain access to the data or attack the system. As new or more advanced cryptographies are introduced, they can be seamlessly included into SAMS.
Stretch Goals: 
As a benefit to our Kickstarter backers, we will issue lifetime licenses per email address, regardless the number of devices used to access the registered email addresses. 
We anticipate in the near future our billing structure will be annual subscription based per email address, as well as potentially including a cost for each additional device. 
Early Access to SAMS:
We want to give all Kickstarter backers early access to the BETA product and to provide feedback to enhance the final product. Throughout the project we will communicate with our backers to coordinate early access to the products. 
Timeline 
From successful project close and meeting stretch goals, the following are the timelines for delivery.
Milestone 1 - Windows Based Application: 45 days for Beta, 60 days for final product
Milestone 2 - Moblie Apps: 90 days for Beta, 120 days for final product

Who Are We?
We are certified Cyber Security professionals with a life-long passion for security and privacy. Our experience in the security field is focused in Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing, Network Security, Computer Network Defense, and Information Privacy Protection.
We started this project because we believe every person has the right to secure and private computing. You should not have to worry about viruses, spyware, hackers, and government surveillance every time you use a computer or access the web. Our mission is to enable people to practice their right to secure and private computing by providing cost effective and easy-to-use tools. 
As featured on: 
 So, What is AnonyStik?
In a nutshell, AnonyStik is a USB stick device that has its own operating system and secure storage volume. You simply plug the device into your computer (PC or Mac) and start it. All of your online activities will be contained within the device, so nothing will affect the computer or laptop hard drive (a computer within a computer basically). 
This is a guaranteed way to protect you against viruses/malware and provide you with online privacy, since nothing is saved or logged by your computer. 
It also has tools that enable you to be online anonymously (masking your IP address) so that no one can monitor your internet traffic and know who you are. 
Most importantly, AnonyStik comes with software and tools that enable you to encrypt and save files that you wish to keep with just a few clicks.
 What Are The Advantages That AnonyStik Offers?
How Does It Work?
 AnonyStik is very easy and simple to use:
If you have a PC that runs Windows or Linux, simply plug in AnonyStik PC edition to the USB port. Press the power button and immediately start tapping the applicable function key to access the boot menu (in most cases that will be F9 or F12). From the boot menu, simply choose the USB drive option and AnonyStik will start within seconds.
If you have a Mac, simply plug in AnonyStik Mac edition. Press the power button and immediately press and hold the Option key to access Startup Manager. Choose the USB media device option called EFI and AnonyStik will start within seconds.
.
How Useful is AnonyStik?
.
Any Prototypes Yet?
Of course! In fact, not only did we develop prototypes, but we also conducted market testing, where select a few got to try our beta product and provided feedback. We used the feedback we received to make AnonyStik better than ever.
Here are the functional prototypes we have:
AnonyStik Prototype - A
AnonyStik Prototype - B
AnonyStik Prototype - C
Why Launch a Kickstarter?
We have taken this project as far as we can using the startup funds that we have. Now we are asking for your support and help to fund this project and help us finish it. 
Your funding will allow us do the following:
 Conduct final testing on the device to make sure we solve any bugs or issues. 
We intend on producing AnonyStik in house to ensure the integrity and quality of the product, so we need to purchase tools and equipment that are required for production and building an inventory. 
Plan for future features and enhancements.
We need your help to promote the product and raise awareness so that together we can help people protect their online security and privacy.
AnonyStik is almost finished. Through your support, we have no doubt that this project will be completed on time. We intend to ship early bird rewards by June 2015.

My name is Michael DeKort and I am asking for your help to finish the construction of an innovative Internet experience. Far different than anything else available today. Jumbawumba provides Personal, Safe, Automated and User Friendly Internet search capability for both Mobile Devices and PCs.
A place where parents and their children, businesses - anyone - can get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. ALL while being safe, secure and UNTRACKED and anonymous to the sites they visit. (Unless Auto Search is requested on an item we will not store any user information at all.)
How invasive is the tracking? This is a new article on this Kickstarter Project.  Look to the right. That is a list of over 100 trackers tracking me as I read this article. If I was using Jumbawumba at the time there would be NONE.

 My goal is to create a more secure internet experience so that you can make the Internet work for you.Use it - Don't let it use you. Jumbawumba provides the following features that no other website can match;
- Private Search and Browsing from your search results
- Automatic Search ‰ÛÒ Receive links to the latest information from anywhere on the Internet. Jumbawumba will search on any item daily or weekly and let you know when new information is available. No longer will you have page through previously viewed results or sites.
- Integrate - All results on to one easy to use Quad page.Jumbawumba provides a unique user interface where News, Web Pages, Images, Videos etc results are all displayed on a single page. No more jumping back and forth between different types of searches.
- Privacy ‰ÛÒ Jumbawumba prevents sites searched from knowing your identity, or tracking your search history. Your search results are private.
- Notifications - Jumbawumba will notify you when new information is available for topics you have chosen to have automatically searched.
- Meta Search ‰ÛÒ Jumbawumba uses all major search engines simultaneously, omits the duplicates and presents the data in an easy to use and understand format. (Engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo)
- Bookmarking and Search/Auto Search Archiving - Easy methods to keep track of and access the information you request.
- RSS Integration
- Web Site Change Tracking
- Google News Integration
- Other features possible ‰ÛÒ email, texting, data storage/back up, parental controls etc
Here is a video of the Website Demo being used live. (The reason it is not live for Kickstarter viewers is that Google limits the daily search quantities in the software development environment. When we go live there will be no limit)

Branding - Independent Revenue Stream
Create a recognizable, marketable and independent revenue generating brand for Jumbawumba and its mascot.
Utilize the brand for product marketing but also for training and entertainment.
Branding Options
Customer and Company Philosophy
Based on my previous experience I believe that I have proven I will defend the public‰Ûªs rights to privacy when it matters most.I have also proven I know how to make robust systems that work under the most difficult situations.Having said that no one should escape objective scrutiny. Not even me. The only people who fear scrutiny are those who fear being exposed. Once fully operational Jumbawumba will provide routine third party verification that your searches are safe, secure and Our goal is to listen to our customers and provide the best possible service and performance.
Explanation for the use of the $125k
The $125k we are asking for is to bring the full product to the market. That includes finishing development, hosting, scaling and closing on necessary legal issues. The only feature of the product we may omit in that first phase would be to the metasearch integration.Since Google is over 70% of world search, and that is our primary search engine, we do not see omitting Bing or Yahoo as showstopper for the first release. However should we receive the funds required to integrate that feature we will. Additionally should the funding surpass what is requested we will also employ a marketing strategy that involves national TV advertising. We will communicate the brand and product capabilities every we can.
Risks and challenges
Current Risk Mitigation
There is a live Demo available to see upon request. It displays all the core features. This means there is very little technical risk in completing the product. And since we store no data (photos, video etc) only links we have no significant storage demands.
I have access to developers as well as a development and Go Live start up environment.
I have filed a provisional patent for the product
I have extensive IT Program and Engineering Management experience
Forward Risk
- Scaling for the right amount of users and spare capacity
We intend to deal with this by growing the local or cloud system as the need becomes available. Should the need drive it we will create our own infrastructure. Also - we intend to host outside of the US. (I realize bad people will use my product. Should the US Government, or any other official body, follow proper legal due process we will assist them in their endeavors to find these people. Additionally I will honor the blacklist Google uses to keep people from visiting websites with malware. We will also extend that blacklist for sites the vast majority of society finds objectionable - like child pornography. Basically if you are bad person doing things the most of society would deem objectionable we do not want your business.)
- Some people and businesses may not understand the value of the product or all of the ways they might find it beneficial - We intend to handle this by providing a FAQ with instructions on how to use the site and ideas for people and business to use the automatic search features. We are looking in to having Jumba featured in cartoons to help with this.
- We are dependent on Google and other search engines and the use of their APIs. While we do not anticipate any issues, and see our product as a net positive for Google and others.
We live in an age where more and more of our personal lives are stored online ‰ÛÓ but even on the most popular social networks and platforms, privacy is treated as an afterthought. The consequences of our blasÌ© attitude towards privacy online are obvious, and examples are everywhere: hackers stealing photos from the cloud, jealous exes snooping through emails, and catastrophic data breaches that leak anything stored unencrypted. 
Signet‰Ûªs goal is to protect our online information from exploitation and theft. It's an open-source, credit card-sized device that's based on open standards for cryptography, and a set of guidelines for how to use it. Signet operates with GnuPG, an open-source implementation of strong cryptographic software. GnuPG is the same tech used by people such as Edward Snowden and Laura Poitras to encrypt their messages. It's what lawyers at the EFF use to communicate with their clients. It's what corporations like Symantec sell to enterprises, to secure their sensitive data. 
By pairing desktop encryption software with a crypto card, Signet is simultaneously easier to use and more secure than desktop software alone. 
PLAY

Why it‰Ûªs more secure: Signet puts your keys on a card that is capable of completing cryptographic tasks without ever sending keys back to your computer. What this means is that even if someone had unfettered access to your computer, they would never be able to access the sensitive keys that protect your data. 
Why it‰Ûªs easier: Since the strength of the protection comes from the inviolability of the information on the card, and not the complexity of a passphrase, you can use a simple PIN to unlock the card, rather than a strong passphrase. Chip and PIN is easy to understand; millions of people use cards and PINs in their everyday lives. 
PLAY

Whether you're a journalist protecting your sources, a lawyer protecting your clients, or just about anyone with sensitive personal photos and information to protect, Signet can help. Right now, today, you can use Signet with GnuPG to encrypt your emails and your files ‰ÛÓ from plain text to photographs, spreadsheets and PDFs. 
For a list of compatible software, check out the "What works with it?" section below. And here's a quick demo video showing email and file encryption on a Mac:   
PLAY

The goal of this Kickstarter is simple: develop a community of everyday people that use OpenPGP. In order to secure both sides of a conversation, it's not enough for one person to use it: both people have to use it. Building a community of OpenPGP users is essential to building the more secure internet that we all want to see. 
Our fundamental goal is to make people more aware of privacy, and of the cryptographic tools we can use to defend against increasingly advanced threats to our data. For $5,000, we can put this system into the hands of 100 people. These first 100 people represent a community, a group of pioneers exploring a better model for privacy and security online ‰ÛÓ and to be clear, I believe we can exceed this goal, building an even bigger community behind this idea. 
What do I get?
Backers will receive a kit consisting of the following items:
One Signet-branded OpenPGP-compatible Smart Card
One folding USB smart card reader
One red USB stick, preloaded with GnuPG and a simple app for making your key
One instructional booklet that explains both the Signet system, and the cryptographic foundations that it builds upon. 
Here's how it works: you use the app on the red USB stick to make your key and copy it to your card. Once you're done, you unplug the stick and seal it in a small envelope (included). This is your backup, in case you lose your card. The smart card then becomes your primary cryptographic device, and you can store it with the rest of your cards in a wallet or purse.
If you lose your card, you can buy another card (naked cards will cost about $20) which allows you to restore the key from your red USB stick. If you are in a more sensitive security situation, you can also create a new key for the new card.
What works with it?
Mac users can use Signet with the GPGTools Suite, which includes a plugin for Apple Mail, as well as tools for encrypting and decrypting files on your hard drive using the Finder. 
Similarly, Windows users can use Signet with Gpg4win for secure email in Outlook or the included Claws mail client. Gpg4win also includes a plugin for encrypting files in Windows Explorer. 
Windows, Mac and Linux users can also use the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client, along with the Enigmail plugin, for secure email. 
If you use the Tails live operating system, your email client is preconfigured for OpenPGP-secured email, and works out of the box with the Signet card and included card reader. 
Is That All? 
At the moment, Signet is a system for encrypting emails to other people who use OpenPGP, as well as files on your computer, but this is just the beginning. The card can perform three basic cryptographic operations: signing, encryption and authentication. With just those cryptographic basics, developers can build more comprehensive systems, such as like full-disk encryption, or passwordless authentication to websites. This card is a stepping stone to building a more secure Internet, the first of many.
The target of $5,000 represents 100 people who are willing to give this system a shot. Every person above the $5,000 goal is one more member of the network ‰ÛÓ one more pioneer in building a better Internet. Let's do this. 
iShutter was invented to prevent those potentially awkward moments when your webcam is accidentally enabled during a Skype conversation or an online conference call. No one wants to get famous from an unintentional embarrassing or personal video going viral!
That‰Ûªs why we created iShutter to be a simple, discrete, always-on solution. A magnetic metal strip that allows you to physically block the embedded webcam on a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air laptop, it's designed to be able to stay on your computer at all times, even when the lid is closed. 
 iShutter has an opening in the center of the strip that lets you easily enable your webcam by sliding the strip left or right, and then block the camera when not in use. Made from cold rolled steel, iShutter is mounted by leveraging existing magnets in your MacBook‰Ûªs lid and it does not interfere with the laptop‰Ûªs ability to fully close and stay closed. 
The strategic placement and shape of iShutter makes it the perfect option for personalization as well. Company logos or custom messaging can be easily engraved on either side of the window for display whenever the computer is open.
Design
Since 2008, all MacBooks now use magnets to keep the lids closed. These magnets are located the same distance from each other and the same distance from the built-in web camera. 11‰Û, 13‰Û and 15‰Û MacBooks all share this common location of magnets.
Most MacBooks also have the web camera vertically aligned with the magnets except MacBook Airs and newer generation MacBook Pros. These have a vertical offset of 2.5mm. Because of this variant, we designed iShutter to have a wider aperture opening to accommodate all models with a single design. iShutter design is Patent Pending (US and International).  
iShutter has gone through several design iterations. We started with the idea of using thin Velcro or multiuse adhesive tape to mount a webcam shield. Once we discovered the location of the MacBook magnets, we immediately started testing various design options that used this to make a simpler, more convenient product. Our first model was much smaller, but was limited to certain MacBooks. We made a few laser cut samples using 0.05mm, 0.20mm and 0.25mm thick cold rolled Steel.

Once we discovered the vertical offset mentioned above, we changed the design slightly to accommodate all models. The design was laser cut in several materials including Blue-Finished and Polished 1095 Spring Steel .005" Thick, Low Carbon Steel Shim Stock Roll .006" Thick, General Purpose Low-Carbon Steel Foil, .007" Thick, Economy Grade 430 Stainless Steel Foil, 0.008" Thick.

The team will continue to look for better, smoother and stronger materials and potentially optimize the design further to achieve desired result for volume production. We will post weekly progress once the project is funded.  
In the future, we will also explore alternative options to have a generic solution for PCs and tablets, but this Kickstarter project is narrowed to MacBook support only.

Rewards 
We hope you are as excited about iShutter as we are! Any support will be greatly appreciated. Here's a list of the various rewards we offer for our backers:

  Cost

Peace of mind is priceless, but it shouldn't be expensive. We want to make iShutter as affordable for users as possible.  
Our goal is that in store cost will not exceed $15. This, however, will depend on the final selection of volume, material, coating and manufacturing process.  
There are few things that are non-negotiable. We want to ensure the end product is high quality, environmental friendly and can be fully manufactured in the USA.  

Why we need your help We have used a lot of time and effort in building a prototype of iShutter and have filed necessary patents and trademarks to move forward. We will use all raised funds to finalize our design and find the most effective way to get iShutter into production in the US.  

Our goal is $8,000, which should just be enough to finalize our current design and get it into production. If we reach $20,000 or more, we will furthermore explore the option of creating a custom tool to allow production using a stamping process.

Project Plan
SCRYPTmail is an end to end encrypted email service with features you will not be able to find anywhere else. We encrypt your email, attachments, subject and even recipient right on your computer so nobody except you and the intended recipient will be able to read it.
SCRYPTmail is not only a privacy tool, but an ultimate email service that gives you exclusive features such as disposable emails, session expiration, and email tagging. We plan to offer custom domain, human only contact email addresses, support for third party email service implementation like mailvelope or other open api projects and many more features based on our users requests. 
We developed a true XXI century email service, where your identity, privacy and online communication is protected from the start.
Features
Our team has years invested in Information Technology, from installing servers and creating web applications to designing networks and working with the bitcoin protocol. 
We've spent months and countless hours developing a secure service that is easy to use. In fact, we not only keep your communication from prying eyes, but we also have designed our service in a such way that even our servers are unaware of who is talking to who.
Don't take our words for granted: all our code is available for public audit to ensure transparency in what we do.
Your support will help us to deploy more servers, get even more talent on our team, deliver additional features, and make the best private email service.
We Need
We opened free beta registration for SCRYPTmail in November 2014. Our server capacity is close to being reached, which has forced us to close free registration. Everyday we receive new account requests but need more resources to make SCRYPTmail available for everyone.
Our initial goal is to raise $25,000 that will go towards acquiring more servers to guarantee service until we establish a sustainable business. Currently this project is supported with our own life savings. We are working hard to develop new features and make it better, but with additional funds we can allocate more resources and hire developers. 
Since we started our beta, we have been able to exceed many similar services with features and innovations and received a great deal of positive feedback from our early adopters.

We decided to make our product before reaching out for funding to prove our concept and show you that we can deliver what we promise.
Four months since our first user we have offered features that others are yet to think about. 

With your support, we can keep our focus on developing and growing our service.

As humans need air to breath, businesses need money to live. 


Value
All of us have certain values in our lives. The most common of them is the right for personal privacy - the right to have space that no one is allowed access without our permission. And now, in internet age, the definition of privacy is becoming blurry and unclear. Government and internet giants have invested billions of dollars into changing our perception of privacy, and have distracted us from the reality of losing that privacy. They are trying to prove we don't need it, giving us no choice but to live under a lens of constant surveillance with all of our life audited, logged and analyzed. 
It's time to take it back. SCRYPTmail is an example that you can take control of your privacy. With your help, we can change the world of online communication forever.
If you just want to send or receive email, why should you share your name,  phone number or your mother's maiden name?

My Driving Pal (MDP) is a combination hardware device and smartphone app that monitors a variety of different things in a person‰Ûªs life including a car, a drone, a bicycle or even a child.
Imagine the peace of mind you will have if, for example, you are visiting Disney Land with your children and one of them wanders off. Instead of panicking, you will be able to track them and locate them immediately. Our tracking device is designed to monitor your 2 to 10-year-old child, typically the age group  that does not have a smart phone.
MDP is the first versatile tracking product that even protects user's privacy. It consists of:
The MDP Device - Battery Powered Hardware
The MDP App - for iOS and Android Phones
The MDP Server - the Backend Server
The MDP Device and App communicate with each other via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When the MDP Device and a phone (on which the MDP App runs) are within range (15 meters) of each other, the MDP App tracks the asset and MDP Device goes into idle mode. In order to protect user's privacy, all tracking data remains locally on the phone and is not transmitted to any Backend Serve. However, when the phone is out of range and yet the object that is carrying the MDP Device is moving, the MDP Device turns on its built-in GNSS (GPS) receiver and Cellular Modem, tracks the asset and immediately notifies the user on his/her phone via remote push notification.
The MDP App allows the user to easily change the type of the asset that is being tracked from the default Vehicle/Motorbike to Person (Child/Elderly) or Bicycle, as shown in the App screenshots below. Users may also adjust the radius of the geo-fencing circle for receiving alerts when the Person exits it.
How about our bikes? We park them outside a coffee shop and by the time we return, they're gone!
That's too bad, but no worries! If your bike is equipped with the MDP device (placed under the seat), you would immediately receive an alert on your phone and could track it on map, no matter how far it moves away. The range is unlimited, because the MDP Device comes with built-in GNSS (GPS) and Cellular modem and will find the location of the bike with an accuracy level of meters, anywhere in the world.
Vehicular Heatstroke: Car getting too hot? MDP Device is equipped with a temperature sensor. If interior temperature of the car gets too hot and it hears noise from inside (pet, child, etc.), MDP App immediately delivers warning (via remote push notification) on user's phone, if he/she is not in close proximity of the car.
Did you know that 37 children die of #heatstroke in vehicles every year? This is not only sad, but also should not be happening at this age of technology, when we are so connected in every place and at every minute.
How about locating our Quadcopters or UAV? Drones - strictly speaking, ‰Û÷multicopters‰Ûª - are ubiquitous now. We see them in the news, behind the camera filming aerial footage, and more frequently in parks. There is something thrilling about zooming through the air, controlling the futuristic device from your mobile phone. If you are one of these guys, then I bet you would also love MDP. You can place (or attach) an MDP Device inside your drone to track it in real-time on your phone and obviously locate it with meters level accuracy, if you ever lose it.
Can the MDP Device automatically track and log driving trips? The answer is: Yes. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a product that automatically record our trips and could show where and how long ago the vehicle was parked. Additionally, if someone is foolish enough to attempt to steal it, you will receive alert immediately on your phone and be able to track it on a map. This feature will help you as well as law enforcement get your vehicle back to you in record time - and mete out justice!
Manual recording of Walking/Running/etc. trips using the App: It doesn't matter if you are a professional runner or a casual walker like me, the  MDP App allows you to manually record your walking, running, biking, or driving trips. It shows the route on a map and updates the  distance and duration of the trip in real-time in both US (foot, mile) and Metric (meter, kilometer) units. The Trips History page of the MDP App lists up to 20 previous trips, as shown in screenshots below. The user has the option to delete those they do not wish to keep. The App will automatically overwrite the earliest entry.
Pre-Ordering MDP on the Celery Platform
We are also accepting pre-orders for the MDP Device 1 and 1s on Celery, which is a great platform for pre-ordering. You will not be charged until your order ships and if you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, you can return the product to us and get a full refund. Please click on links below to pre-order MDP Device 1 or 1s on Celery:
MDP Device 1 on Celery
MDP Device 1s on Celery
 World-Wide Coverage
The current version of MDP Device, which is going to be delivered through this campaign, works in at least 88 countries (including the United States, European Union, Russia, Japan, India, South Africa, Australia, and many more). We are getting our cellular data service from Aeris and our modem is 3G (that is also compatible with 2G). To find out if your area is covered, please check this website.  On the website, please go to "GSM Data Coverage Map‰Û section and then click on ‰ÛÏView Detailed Coverage‰Û button. The only geographical limitation associated with MDP product is the cellular (mobile) network availability. GPS, Bluetooth Low Energy, and MDP Apps all work fine everywhere in the world.
V2V and V2I Communications via MDP
Starting 2017, when cars begin talking with each other on the roads via DSRC-based V2V and V2I wireless communications, MDP (as an off-the-shelf product) will be there to enable such communications for the existing cars, like my Chevy from 2006 that does not have any GPS or connectivity. In fact, there are more than 250M cars in the US alone (and more than one billion in the world); every year about 15M new cars enter the US market, hence just 6% of the total. In 2014, only 10% of these new cars were connected (meaning that had some sort of capability to wirelessly transmit data). Average life of a car is plus 11 year. Thus, it will take at least a couple of decades before majority of the cars being connected and capable of communicating with each other and/or infrastructure.
Current version of the MDP Devices does not support V2V or V2I feature. However, we are on top of it and as soon as the auto companies roll out cars with such capability, we will also upgrade our devices. We pledge to ship one MDP Device with V2V and V2I capability to all supporters of this campaign at that time.
Other Use Cases
MDP may be used to monitor and track any moving object, from Luggage to Ski gears, to Surfboard. In fact, one great use case can be surfing. MDP Device 1s is water-proof and may be used to record the surfing distance and routes. MDP App pulls the recorded information, when phone comes within range of the Device, after surfing. User can also setup a geo-fencing radius for the Device to automatically transmit the position information, when she moves too far from the shore. This feature can potentially save lives.
Size of MDP
The MDP Device comes in two models for this campaign:
MDP Device 1
MDP Device 1s
As shown in the image below, the "MDP Device 1" is slightly bigger than a credit card, but fairly thin at 10 mm (about the thickness of iPhone 4S). "MDP Device 1s" is smaller than a credit card, but a little thicker at 15 mm. The MDP Device 1s easily fits under a bike's saddle (seat).
MDP Device Colors
The MDP Device comes in five colors: White, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Pink.
MDP Feature Breakdown
MDP Device consists of the following major components:
Bluetooth Low Energy chip from CSR
GNSS receiver from Furuno
Cellular modem from Sierra Wireless
Atmega processor from Atmel
Accelerometer sensor
Temperature sensor
mini USB connector
1500 mAh Li-Ion Battery
SIM card
Buzzer
Current Status
We have designed and manufactured the first version of the "MDP Device 1" and we are currently developing the firmware. We are also in the process of manufacturing the "MDP Device 1s", which is smaller in size. The MDP Server is fully developed and up and running on Amazon Cloud EC2. iOS version of the MDP App is fully developed. A Beta version of the Android App is ready as well.
We have also developed a separate iOS App called the "MDP iOS Device", that emulates our hardware. This App, together with the MDP IOS App are available for download on iTunes TestFlight. Please email us if you would like to test these iOS Apps. The Android App is not fully developed yet. You can evaluate almost all features of the MDP solution using these iOS Apps, except battery consumption and very early detection of movements. Please note that Apps must run on two separate phones. The iPhone must be 4s or newer. As for Android, it should be OS version 4.3 (API level 18) or newer. The majority of new Android phones support Bluetooth Low Energy. To check if you Android phone supports it, please check this website.
Use of Fund
We will use this campaign's fund to support the following tasks:
Hardware Development and Refinement
Firmware Refinement 
Develop Waterproof Enclosure (case) for MDP Devices
Power Consumption Optimization
Certifications - FCC, CE, PTCRB
Customer support
Technical Details
The GNSS receiver of the MDP device is the GN87, made by eRide (formerly based in San Francisco, now a Furuno company). It is one of the best of its kind in the market. Shahram, founder of MDP, worked for more than 8 years at eRide and was the main developer of eRide's long-term GNSS aiding data (known as LTCSM). This aiding data enables the receiver to determine its position within seconds, even in tough environments. Long term aiding data are good for 7 days. At MDP, we have implemented an innovative method (patent-pending) to transfer this aiding data to the receiver inside the MDP device. As shown in the diagram below, the MDP App downloads this data from our backend server, which itself receives the data from Furuno's GNSS Aiding server. When the MDP device and phone are within range of each other, the App sends the GNSS aiding data to the device via Bluetooth Low Energy.
When the BLE connection between phone and device breaks, the MDP device starts monitoring the movement of the object carrying the device. Upon observing a movement, it transmits location data of the object to MDP server. The server then sends a remote push notification to the App in order to notify the user about the event and query if he/she would like to track the movement or simply dismiss the alert.
There are some cellular based tracking devices in the market that claim to be able to determine the location within 100 meters accuracy level, but don't believe it! To prove it for yourself, use an Android phone and run a Network Location App, like Network Location Tracker, to find out how poor the accuracy is, even when there are several cellular towers around the phone. Actual accuracy of these systems is from several hundred meters to a few kilometers. They determine a device's location by scanning nearby GSM cellular towers. The Location of cellular towers are mostly known (check Opencellid for example) and distance to each tower can be roughly estimated from  the strength of the received cellular signal. To achieve even a 500 meter accuracy, a strong signal from three or more GSM cellular towers needs to be received. This is not possible in many regions. Out of the biggest US carriers, only AT&T and T-Mobile run on GSM networks, while Verizon and Sprint use CDMA technology. So, the three cellular towers mentioned above can only be from AT&T or T-Mobile.
 Schedule
We are very excited to deliver the MDP Devices and Apps to our supporters by November 15 of 2015. Our iOS Apps are already available for download on iTunes via TestFlight. The Android version of the App will be ready by July 15 of 2015. We will start shipping our evaluation boards to the backers that have selected this reward on September 15 of 2015.

Online privacy, blah that's too complicated. But what if it wasn't?
Black Card is designed to accomplish two goals: simplify the complexities of online privacy and to make the entire experience exciting, fun, and intuitive.
Tails OS is one of the most sophisticated, open source platforms on the market providing online privacy. The only downside to Tails is that the initial install and configuration is very complex and confusing. Black Card circumvents this obstacle by pre-installing Tails OS with automatic updates to ensure the most secure version is always installed. In addition, we've created aesthetically pleasing visual tutorials guiding less technical users through software features within Tails required to securely communicate online.
Privacy Features
5GB Storage Encryption | Protecting documents and images is paramount. Black Card implements LUKS storage encryption (AES-CBC-ESSIV:SHA256) providing 5Gb of secure file storage, for all of your fun documents.
Booting Method | The Tails OS boots from your computers RAM memory. This means that as soon as you disconnect the Black Card, all log files of your business on that computer are permanently erased.

Preserving Internet Privacy
Have you been following the latest news on Apple when it comes to personal privacy? 
http://www.cnet.com/news/tim-cook-apple-fbi-unlocking-iphone-would-be-bad-for-america/
The model around how data encryption is managed by a third party is not truly secure.  Anonymy has solved this issue by making you and only you the keeper of your own encryption keys.  This means that you and only you can decide when your privacy should be breached.
Have you ever felt insecure online? Are you worried that someone may be monitoring you when banking online? Are you concerned your WebMD and Amazon searches may be seen by prying eyes?  
You're justified in your concerns; companies know more about your life than you may know.

Big companies provide secure connections for online transactions - just enough security to make you feel safe giving them your financial credentials, like credit card numbers - but often sell your shopping preferences, among other information, to ad agencies. Ever wonder how Google and Yahoo make money? They sell insights and targeted advertising based on the profiles they collect about YOU!
Advertisers know more about you than you may know
How do I protect myself?
Enter Anonymy. Anonymy (patents pending) is a physical device that creates a virtual private network (VPN) on top of your existing WiFi network, enabling anti-tracking capabilities for all connected devices.
Why Anonymy?
Anonymy is a private VPN solution that drastically improves your security while browsing the web. While anti-tracking software already exists, Anonymy is a zero-configuration, physical device that ensures your connection is secure for all connected devices.   
We've seen other companies that offer either a server-side VPN or a client-side internet appliance, but configuration is difficult and very expensive. Anonymy is a low-cost alternative that empowers the individual to take control of their online identity. 

We work at big companies and have dealt with the complexities of public-private key encryption, VPN networks, and data secrecy. This experience has given us the tools and the desire to keep your online identity safe.
Anonymy will also block malicious ads that may be a threat to your security. 
Signal Haystacks is an identity management company that enables you and only you to keep your identity safe.
Anti-tracking + traffic encryption ‰ Õ better identity protection  
Setup - It's super easy!
1) Plug the device into your router with the provided ethernet cable 
2) Power it up with the provided cable
3) Connect to the new WiFi access point for a secure connection
How it works
Anonymy will automatically connect to our servers, negotiate a brand new asymmetric-key exchange, verify the signatures to ensure no active man-in-the-middle attack took place, and setup a VPN tunnel that keeps all your internet data secure from most prying eyes. Your data is encrypted before it even gets to your ISP router, this means your ISP can't eavesdrop on you. Even we can't see your data - you and only you hold the private key and it changes every hour or so. Most VPN services have one public-private key per customer. Once that key is cracked all data can be compromised. The dynamic key system we have developed has added yet another layer of protection. 
The only time your data may not be encrypted is when it makes the final hop to the site you are connecting to. By then, your location and much of your personal identifying attributes have been stripped off. No one can tie that request directly back to you. If you're on an HTTPS site, we can't strip off as much identifying information because your data is encrypted all the way to the final destination site, but we can still remove some of the IP and location data.
Pricing
Anonymy device - $150
Encryption service - $5/month/gigabyte of bandwidth (high-volume, streaming services like Netflix and Hulu are excluded from the bandwith cap)

Update
Woman getting dressed in 26th floor apartment terrified by peeping drone [in downtown Seattle] on June 22, 2014
Project Update #2: Video Interview on KGW News Channel 8 (NBC Portland, OR news affiliate)
After the scare in Seattle, we were interviewed on June 25, 2014 for a feature story titled Oregon City company creates 'Drone Detector' by the KGW Business Reporter, Joe Smith. Check it out!
Background
On May 8, 2014 a drone shooting high definition video crashed into a high rise building in downtown St. Louis. Who was flying it and why they were shooting video so close to the building is still unknown.
Could this drone be flying around your building and invading your privacy in the near future?
Drones are becoming more available and can be operated by anyone who can fly a Remote Controlled plane. You may have noticed how many drones are being sold on Kickstarter, DIY Drones and Amazon, just to name a few.
In fact, CEO of California drone maker, 3D Robotics, sells about 2000 autopilot systems per month to customers around the world who want to build their own drones. He estimates that one Chinese competitor, DJI Innovations, sells at least 10 times as many drones. 
From just these two companies, over 300,000 drones are being put into the skies this year alone. This is alarming!
According to Senator Feinstein on the 60 Minutes video below, the FAA has no rules to regulate the use of these smaller drones and any drone regulation will not be updated until 2015, at the earliest.
We keep seeing all sorts of stories about drones in the news. We read about near misses with aircraft and drones crashing into the ground, as happened in New York City last October and as shown in the video below.

Your Privacy
Drones are becoming more capable all the time and this is why it's alarming. They fly with payloads like still cameras, video cameras, infrared detectors, thermal detectors, among other things, and they are already being used for surveillance.
Though there are legitimate uses for domestic drones, there is still concern about invasion of privacy and surveillance by various entities. Groups like the ACLU are concerned about your privacy and the future of drones in America.

Our Project
Luckily, we at Domestic Drone Countermeasures have been working on protecting your privacy from drones and cameras on drones for over a year now. In the past year, we developed hardware that can detect drones and have filed patents to safeguard our technology.  The patents are currently being converted from provisional patents to full patents. You may have seen us on:
The intent of DDC's Personal Drone Detection System is not to counter military drones.  They fly too high and are too sophisticated.  Our intent is to keep your privacy safe from your neighbors and people you may not know who are flying small drones near your home or office.  The Personal Drone Detection Systems are intended to counter small, personal drones with cameras and other sensors that are not being regulated.
The first step in countering drones is to detect them.  That is why we need your help.  Our first prototype detection systems are effective at identifying drones in the lab, but we need more real world testing scenarios. Below is a video of Early Testing of Prototype Systems.
PLAY

Basic Personal Drone Detection System
Prototype models of the Personal Drone Detection System
The Basic Personal Drone Detection System consists of three boxes: a Primary Command and Control Module and two Detection Sensor Nodes.  These three boxes create a mesh grid network that can triangulate moving transmitters. 
Triangulation of Drone Transmitters
The Primary Command and Control Module offers a simplified user interface via WiFi, such as through your tablet, smartphone or PC.
If a signal is not purposely ignored by you, then the system assumes that the rogue transmitter is hostile and alerts you to its presence within the mesh grid.  It sounds an alarm (which can be disabled) or sends a message to your tablet or smartphone.  This allows the system to notify you, even if you are not home.
The software is designed to reduce false triggering as much as possible.  Software updates will continue to be available in order to  reduce false triggering based on field results.
The Primary Command and Control Module is based on the Linux operating system running on APlus Mobile's MotherBone‰ã¢PiOne‰ã¢ open source software platform. 
The module and nodes utilize a mesh grid network that only communicates within itself, but the Primary Command and Control Module can communicate with your personal WiFi network as an isolated device.  Neither the module nor nodes extend your personal WiFi network so your personal WiFi network is not susceptible to outside hacking or infiltration through the mesh grid. 
Why it Works
The Drone Detection Grid is essentially a custom wireless mesh grid  network and its advantages include:
The more nodes you install, the larger your Detection Grid becomes.
Detection Grids are "self configuring;" the network automatically incorporates a new node into the existing structure without needing any adjustments by a network administrator.
Detection Grids are "self healing," since the network automatically finds the fastest and most reliable paths to send data, even if nodes are blocked or lose their signal.
Wireless Detection Sensor Nodes are easy to install and uninstall, making the Detection network extremely adaptable and expandable as more or less coverage is needed.
The Personal Drone Detection System sensor network is expandable to include additional Detection Sensor Nodes to provide large area coverage.  Additional Sensor Detection Nodes can be purchased to increase the size of your wireless mesh grid.  This enables scaling of the detection system automatically as described in Wikipedia here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network
Command and Control Modules can be linked together to form a larger coordinated detection array.
Mesh Coverage Diagram

More product information can be found on our website.
System Specification
The Primary Command and Control Module can typically communicate with nodes up to 200 feet away. 
Each Detection Sensor Node can typically detect drones within 50 feet in all directions.  Frequency detection range is 1MHz - 6.8GHz. 

The Future
In order for us to continue with this project, we need your help to fund and field test the first production models. The first users are our Alpha Testers, and we really need your feedback.  We are offering a deep discount for your feedback.  Your help will assist us in improving the product and overcoming any hurdles.  Your feedback is invaluable, and we will work closely with you to get valid results. 
The 2nd generations models (Beta) will incorporate the lessons learned from the Alpha Test group and will be available after Alpha testing concludes.

Take control of your privacy with Project Shotblock, a stylish, non-intrusive device that protects you from unwanted webcam intruders.
* Portable computers are used in EVERY room of the house.
* Every camera is a potential window into your personal life.
* Lives have been shaken, ruined, and cut short because of webcam hacking.
Take Control of Your Privacy with Project Shotblock!
It is the hardware solution to a highly-exploited software problem!
 Computer security experts suggest that webcams are covered up when not in use and that all computers are equipped with anti-virus software to protect people from webcam hackers. Project Shotblock protects you and your family from prying eyes. 
What makes Project Shotblock better than the alternatives? 
The Shotblock is universally sized, re-usable, removable, and NON-ADHESIVE, so it won't damage or scratch your camera lens. It won‰Ûªt shift unless you move it and it can be used over and over again. The Shotblock is thin enough to be left on when you close the laptop, even if you have the thinnest model on the market. 
The Project Shotblock "clip" fits every laptop we tested. We took each revision to the big box retailers to test for fit and sizing against dozens of popular laptop brands and models. We also have access to a computer recycling facility where we tested various laptops. It even fits most tablets! An analog solution to a digital problem; a solution you can trust.
We've included some articles for a wider ranging look on this problem:

That was just a few examples of scary hackers spying on innocent people. Now watch the desktop of a computer hacker who has gained total control of unsuspecting people's computers. This is what it looks like on the other side of the lens.
(This is creepy, so please use your own judgment when deciding if you want to watch the videos):
You can never be sure if a link, image, or doc has a Trojan that will allow hackers access to your computer and control over your camera. 
Computer security experts have offered advice on how users can protect themselves against "ratting" (hacker control), suggesting that webcams be covered up when not in use and all PCs be equipped with anti-virus software.
Protect Your Privacy!
Project Shotblock has been through multiple redesign phases to make sure we deliver the most efficient and effective product. We are currently working on finishing our final prototype before the official launch and the launch color will be decided on by our very own supporters! Shortly after the launch, Shotblock will be available in a variety of colors, including swirl-color combinations.
Anticipated launch color will be decided by our very own supporters!  Shortly thereafter Shotblock will be available in a variety of colors along with swirl-color combinations. We will also be soliciting large, custom orders.  
Project Shotblock can be customized for different colors, text, and can even include your company's logo!
A demonstration of a red Shotblock on a 15" MacBook Pro.
Here is a brief product demonstration using the Photo Booth application on a MacBook Pro.  In the first image you can see a computer user who is actively using their webcam and has a Shotblock slid aside on the lid of their laptop.
Shotblock puts you in control of your webcam by allowing the user to easily slide it aside when they want to use their webcam.
Shotblock ensures that when used correctly over your webcam, not even the best computer hacker will be able to see you.
Shotblock is also perfect for company wide security or as a tradeshow giveaway.  Instead of giving away a pencil or pen with your company's logo, give people something that is practical for them to use! Get your company's name out there while also protecting your employee's and client's privacy.  We can customize large group orders using YOUR COMPANY LOGO!  Various other customizations will be available after launch.
Manufacturing:
We have partnered with a family owned manufacturing shop in New Jersey that has helped us develop the clip from the original technical drawings to our most recent prototype.  
We have made six prototypes with the shop, and they can fabricate a prototype in less than one week.
Once we have reached our target goal, we will fulfill the order. It will take up to four weeks to create the mold and start mass production.
We have a close working relationship with the factory owners and can receive preferential treatment.
We have looked into a few options in terms of order fulfillment services, and also can do manual fulfillment if necessary.
We are planning on shipping the product with a cd of useful security tools and in proper packaging.
We have sourced alternative manufacturers for a wider release if there is sufficient demand.
Our first sketches of Shotblock.
We hope to raise over $2000.00 to help complete our first batch of units and pay for costs associated with obtaining the utility patent (a future design patent is anticipated if we achieve market traction).  Our goal is to deliver the finished product as soon as possible to help you start protecting yourselves fast.

JUST-N-CASE SMARTPHONE OVERVIEW
The first true PRIVACY case for the iPhone 5 and 6, and the Samsung S5 and S6.*
Cleverly designed to protect your phone from physical damage, while also protecting your privacy from cyber criminals.
Maintains easy port access.
High quality construction.
Innovative, practical, and timely.
* As always, iPhone and Samsung are the Registered Trademarks of their respective entities.  
BACKGROUND
With easily obtainable software, malicious hackers can take control of almost any smartphone, even when that phone is completely powered off. They can still access the front and rear facing cameras, and literally watch and capture everything you do in real time. Your phone essentially becomes a spy camera. Everywhere you go, everything you do - at home, at work, in your car, during your private time ‰ÛÒ can now easily be violated by these cyber criminals.

JUST IMAGINE
You‰Ûªre in the park with your children, and from your smartphone, cyber criminals are taking photos and videos of your children for their own personal use.
You‰Ûªre in your home office paying bills, and identity thieves are snapping photos of your account numbers and personal information.
You‰Ûªre in a corporate meeting, and hackers are watching and stealing your company‰Ûªs trade secrets from your smartphone camera.
You‰Ûªre at a restaurant or club, checking emails on your smartphone from the ladies room, and cyber voyeurs are taking photos and videos of you.
Smile! You just might be on camera while using your smartphone!
DON'T BE LEFT EXPOSED!
Just-N-Case allows you to take control and take back your privacy. The only viable way to prevent malicious hackers from compromising your privacy is to physically block your smart phone's cameras. Physical solutions are the answer, because any software solution can be hacked and bypassed.

Venux introduces a revolutionary keyless security system where databases are not used and passwords are never stored. Your credentials are only stored in your mind. We guarantee with 100% certainty that data encrypted with Venux is inaccessible to hackers, spies, and all other unwanted surveillance. Our goal is to provide users with the privacy they deserve using user-friendly software. We do not store your personal data to achieve maximum security.
Venux Files is a universal file management system that is easy to use, secure, and provides access to many cloud-based services such as DropBox and iCloud. Venux Files provides users with a convenient way to store, access, and manage files securely from any location. Anything encrypted with Venux will only be visible to the account used during the encryption process.
Screenshots of Venux Files (click to enlarge).
Venux Connect is a communication tool designed to provide secure communication for you and your contacts through video call, audio call, and chat. The application simplifies the process of sharing files and screen sharing. You can easily manage your business or keep in touch with your contacts.
Add-ons
Group video calls

More add-ons are in development and will be available in the future.
Supported Platforms
Venux Files, Connect, and MME will be supported on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.
Venux programs will be released for Windows and Mac on the first release.
The current supported protocols are FTP, Amazon, Azure, Box.net, WebDAV, DropBox, EDI, Google Drive, iCloud, SFTP, SkyDrive, SSH, and Yandex. More services will be available in the future.
All Prepaid Encryption Plans are non-expiring.
An encryption plan is required for encrypting and sharing encrypted data. Viewing and decrypting data is free.
How Do Prepaid Encryption Plans Work?
Whenever you'd like to encrypt or share encrypted files, the size of the encrypted data will be deducted from your encryption plan. Everyone receives 2GB for free. Say you have 10GB of encryption and want to encrypt a 500MB size file. After encryption, you will have 9.5GB left to encrypt other data.
All encrypted files are displayed in their decrypted form automatically through Venux software and can be viewed anytime. You must decrypt encrypted data to be able to view it without Venux software. Again, viewing and decrypting does not affect the amount of encryption you have left.
There are several more projects in development, such as a web browser that allows secure and anonymous browsing, an operating system that is completely secure and fully customizeable for business and personal use, and mobile versions of Venux Files, MME, and Connect. The goal is to design a new generation platform for the 21st century. A system that is completely standards compliant for the new emerging Web 3.0 as well as algorithmically based under the hood that works ‰ÛÏout-of-the-box‰Û in any environment without configuration.
We will use the funds to continue development, release the software to the general public, and to gain public awareness.

 How does it work:
Functions Shade, Privacy, Kickstand, and Largest iPhone wallet capacity
Many cell phone cases are difficult to get the phone in and out.  Our case is easy to insert the phone in.  All you do is slide the phone in underneath the top two tabs, pull the bottom down until the phone clips in place. 
Clip in function
The shields stay flat in the side of the case until the user needs to raise them to either block the sun and cast a shadow on the screen, or block others from viewing what is on your screen.

Why We need Funding:
We have worked diligently and made all the fine tunes on the prototype. We are now at the stage where we can begin building the molds and start manufacturing  This is where we need your help.  Building the actual mold for the injection molding, can be very expensive.  Our dream is to one day manufacture the product in the U.S., and with your help, that may come true.   For now, our plan is to raise enough money to begin manufacturing and provide great value with a quality product at an affordable price.   We have made all the arrangements with manufacturing, designing, packaging and shipping.  
IGS File
We have all of the designs and specifications finished, now we are waiting to raise the funds to bring this project to life.  We have considered outside investors, but we do not want the outside influences that go with them. This project is our brainchild and we do not want to cheapen the experience for our potential customers.   
Action!
We think this is an awesome product and we are really excited about it, but we need your help to turn it into a reality. We have lots of exciting discounts and offers available to our early backers, and we hope that we can turn this product into a something special that you are going to love as much as we do.
Who we are:
From the video and story you probably have a good idea of who we are as inventors, professionals and family members.  As a company we want to be different and create a recognizable face to EyeShield.  The only way to do that, is to be better then any of our competitors. 
1.   We will do this with high quality products.  Our cases are made from polycarbonate and delrin, nylon 6/6.  This material is stronger more durable and twice as expensive to produce.  We do this to insure a strong durable case and shields.
2.  We want to create long term relationships with our customers.  We plan on doing this with the first of a kind guarantee.  Most companies will guarantee their cell phone cases for a lifetime.  The truth is most people only keep their cell phones for 2 years.  Therefore we are not only going to offer a warranty but we are planning to offer an upgrade offer.  IF YOU UPGRADE YOUR PHONE WE WILL UPGRADE YOUR CASE.  For example if you had an iPhone 4 and upgraded to a 5, you just send in your iPhone 4 case with a shipping and handling fee and we will upgrade your case to a 5 for NO ADDITIONAL COST.
3. We will listen to what customers want.  You can tell from our story we have made several improvements to the case from suggestions.  We never plan on stop listening to what you want and try to incorporate it into our case.  For example we are working on including a removable back up battery to store in the case.
4.  We want to have fun.  If you're not having fun doing what your doing, you need to change what your doing.  I believe the only way to be the best is to enjoy yourself.  My father told me growing up, "If you love your job, you will never work a day in your life."  I understand that more now than ever.  I love my job as a teacher, yet the excitement I feel when people use and enjoy the case is awesome.  I want to continue to chase that feeling.  Even the negative comments help propel us forward in ways to make improvements.
The Future: 
We have met with a high number of injection mold makers and are set to produce the product.  We have the prototype dialed in and the drawings uploaded and created in Solidworks.  (Solidworks is the software used by manufacturers to create the molds to build the product)  
Solid works file
We also have prototypes completed for the iPhone 4 and 4S as well as the iPad Mini.  We are excited about the iPad mini because it's shields can be removed and reattached both vertically and horizontally.  We created a slide feature in the shield to allow them to change widths. Hopefully, with a successful campaign around the EyeShield for iPhone 5, we can start another project on KickStarter to bring that product to market too!
As a company, we want to build our brand to become "your last cell phone case."  We plan on doing this by creating the highest quality cell phone case at the best price.  We are always looking for feedback and ideas on how to improve out product.  As a business professor I know from research, the most successful companies give customers more in value then they pay in cost.  We are always looking to innovate and improve to give you the best and most affordable product.

The Story:
  EyeShield is an invention as many and born from necessity. The story began with me at the pool during summer break. I am a college business professor and teach classes at night so I can spend the days with my kids at the pool. So it is safe to say I don‰Ûªt really work for a living. Anyway, I got tired of shading my phone with one hand and trying to text replies with the other hand. I remember looking around and seeing everyone else doing the same thing.

So I bought an anti-glare shield, yet it did not work very well. So I thought about coming up with a cover that could retract back into the case. Just like the old boy scout collapsible cups.
Boy scout cups
That night I searched the internet for a cell phone case that would shield the sun. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately I couldn't find anything. Having no background in engineering and no artistic ability, I tried to draw out my idea. I created the original drawings and started showing them to people, who were to say the least,  not impressed.  I wonder why?
my original drawing
Because of my inability to draw, I downloaded Google sketchup and watched a couple tutorial videos on YouTube. I then began to design the product. After several attempts on the design, I felt like giving up because even if I came up with a good design, I felt like I could never finish it properly. 
Early Sketch up drawing
One night I was watching the science channel and they were showing 3D printers and what they could print. I started to search the internet and found 3D printer Experience in Chicago.
3D Printer Experience Chicago
I called them and talked to Jackson about my design. He explained to me if I could design it on Sketchup, they could print it. So I brought in my design and to my disappointment, it is was unprintable.
Early Design
I didn't have the money to hire a designer (because I am a business professor) so I dedicate myself to learning the software. Thanks to Jackson, he sat down and explained to me how to design the product without errors. I finished the drawings and sent them in to be printed. When the parts came back they were a disaster. The pieces didn't fit correctly and the original design was clumsy and bulky. 
The Original Spartan Shield
Although somewhere in there I could see potential. I kept designing and printing to figure out the flaws. Unfortunately for me, I am a spatial learner so I have to feel what 2mm is rather then see it on a screen. After 20 or more prints I finally got the prototype to work.

Spartan shield 1.1
I was ecstatic with the design, but again my excitement was squashed. I designed it for an iPhone.  Oops,  I don‰Ûªt have an iPhone.  I have a Galaxy. I quickly searched Craigslist and purchased an iPhone to use with the case. As soon as I got the phone and case together my 9 year old daughter pleaded to have one, so I gave it to her and went back to using my Galaxy.
Daughter using Phone
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:
The excitement the case generated from her using it got me excited that maybe I have something to produce and sell. I then did a preliminary patent search and could not find anything like it. I then decided to get a professional search done, and still nothing. I filed for a patent in August 2013, and began working on the case to make it more sleek and functional. 
Patent Filing
Shockingly after my daughter had the case for a few days she had bent the top shield back and set it like a kickstand to Facetime with her friends. I asked her what happened? she said "sorry dad I broke it." I said no you just gave it a new function," and the kickstand was born. 
Kickstand
A week later she came to me and asked "Dad, could you put a cover on the back so I can keep my money in there when I go to dance." It then became apparent my daughter was much smarter than I, and the case storage was born.
Early version with removable back
She then complained she couldn't see the Apple emblem. "Dad really, how is anyone going to know I have an iPhone?" Wha lah the viewing window was born.
back of case
Two days later she came to me and said "Dad, I can't hear my speakers when I stand it up while I facetime" she then asked "could you move the speakers." Well I told her, I couldn't move the speakers, but I did put directional arches so they would reflect the sound towards her". Proud of myself I asked her what she thought? she replied, "I guess that will be fine." 
speaker deflectors
After I made a couple of different prototypes, I dyed them different colors and requested thoughts from my 4 teenage nieces and nephews. Kelly, a junior in high school could not decide what color to use as a shield? She then asked, "Uncle, make it so I can take the shields off? I asked her "why, they are there to block the sun, if you take them off they don't work." She replied "No, I want to be able to switch out the shields, using many different colored shields at different times" Duh, I should have known she was up to something ingenious. :) The removable shields were born!
Removable shields
I am not sure what my family will come up with next for the new version, but I am anxious to find out. 
From there on I partnered with my brother-in-law and we began this process to bring the EyeShield to you. He has the experience and expertise on how to bring a new product to market. He previously worked for Fujitsu and was the driving force in selling the highly successful ScanSnap product line. He agreed to team up with me on one condition, I change the name from ‰ÛÏSpartan Shield‰Û to ‰ÛÏEyeShield‰Û being that the original prototype is for an iPhone. 
original idea for logo
I agreed and we came up with the logo as the eye of Horas, who by the way is the Egyptian sun God. 
Eye shield Logo
IT IS NOW ALL UP TO YOU AND YOUR SUPPORT.

Summary:
Cell phone calls are typically encrypted as they travel through the air.  In some cases though they may not be.  An increasing number of Rogue cell phone towers have been identified in the USA and beyond.  These towers can be made for under $1,000 even by non-techies. The parts and instructions are readily available online.  Essentially almost anyone with a little bit of motivation and money can eavesdrop on your calls.
On Android phones there is nothing to indicate that you may have connected to a rogue tower or that voice encryption has been disabled.    An issue with Google has been open since 2009 to create an indicator notifying you if encryption is currently enabled and if so what encryption algorithm is being used.  Think of it like the Green lock icon you see when you visit your banks website.
The Problem:
Whist technically possible there is currently no indicator of encryption or tower status on Android phones.   ‰ÛÏIMSI Catchers‰Û  or ‰ÛÏRogue Cell Phone Towers‰Û are now somewhat easy to create with guides readily available online.     An increasing number of these devices have been witnessed in the wild.  Most recently in Washington DC, and Las Vegas.
Your phone will automatically connect to one of these Rogue towers. To you, the connection would be indistinguishable from a real tower.  At that point the tower operator can disable encryption, eavesdrop, gather your contacts, texts and more.
More details on the problem can be found in these news articles:
Rogue Cell Towers Discovered in DC
Fed's using "Stingrays" on Planes
Stingray Device ‰ÛÒ Google News
Dirtbox - Google News
Rogue Cell Towers - Cryptophone
The Solution:
The primary goal of this Kickstarter is to solve Google Issue 5353 by creating a Cipher indicator on Android phones.  Ideally this indicator will be similar to the Green Lock icon you see when visiting your banks website.    A member of Google‰Ûªs security team has offered to help work with anyone who wants to resolve this issue.  The funding for this Kickstarter would go directly into development of the Cipher indicator.
Dependent upon funding and Google cooperation the next goal would be to implement features that identify when your phone attempts to connect to a rogue tower.

Static Cling Camera Covers for You!
Over 50 individual, reusable Static Cling Camera Covers in each sheet will bring you peace of mind, protect your privacy and brighten up all your devices!  Simply place a static cling camera cover on any camera lens to ensure hackers cannot get video streams of you without your knowledge.  
Hi, I'm Jeff.  Let me tell you the story of how this came to be.  My friend and I started our company, Despicably Good, LLC, to write apps.  Along the way, we realized that we sit in front of internet enabled cameras all day, every day. I'm sure you spend a good deal of time in front of these devices too. So when news broke about hackers breaking into people's web cams, baby monitors and other internet enabled video capable devices, we got concerned. I didn't want video of me to be streamed all over the internet for nefarious purposes. More than that, when I thought of the possibility of my wife, my family and friends being unwittingly recorded, I had to do something!
So Static Cling Camera Covers was born!
The static clings completely block light from even entering the camera lens, so you can be sure no matter what video of you is not being stolen. Plus, the fun designs fit any camera lens and look great!
How did we choose the design, you ask? Well, everyone loves a good happy face emoji, so that was a must.  My wife likes the bumble bee, and I like the butterfly so those choices made it to the sheet.  The "No NSA" sign is a great conversation piece.  And the dots, camera lens replicas, and blank black or white spaces are all for a subtler look that still protects your privacy.  Flower, target, sun and star all add to the fun factor!  Plus, each Static Cling Camera Cover sheet packs in over 50 individual clings!
When will I get my stuff?  
The designs are near final, the print shop has printed several small batch test runs, and some of the first test runs are still clinging to my fridge after six months of hanging out!  And, my wife, my business partner and I have been using the clings on our laptops, iPhones, Android phones, iPads and more for all that time too, meaning the product is fully tested!  
So, as soon as we're funded, I'll finalize the design, print the full batch, purchase the shipping materials and send the survey out to all of you to get your US shipping addresses.  Once I get the Static Cling Camera Covers printed in bulk, I'll start the fulfillment process - mailing out the Static Cling Camera Covers to all of you!  Based on previous, small batch runs, I expect about 2-4 week printing turn around so delivery to all of you in August to early September!
Another little note: I mention it in the video, post it on our web site, and print it on the Static Cling Camera Cover sheets themselves, but I want to say it again here.  Please, keep small plastic items away from babies and unsupervised kids.
Thank you for your support!
-Jeff
The Premise
Our Fridge is an app for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8 that allows you to create private spaces to share images and messages with your friends and family.
It starts with creating a Fridge. This becomes your personal sharing space. Next, you invite the people that you want to share with on the Fridge. Finally, you start sharing with the people that really matter! Everyone that belongs to a Fridge can share with each other using the sharing space.
The app works on the premise that you only want to share with those that you explicitly invite and share with. Unlike most social networks, Our Fridge does not assume that every post is meant for everyone. This not only ensures your privacy, but also secures your images, messages, and data.
By finally having control over your content, you can share your life's moments with those that matter and without fear of over-exposing.
Each Fridge becomes your personal sharing space where you can upload pictures, messages, and comments with the members you invite. Note: All screenshots are from a current build of the app running on Windows Phone 8.
The Origin
The idea for Our Fridge came from previous experiences with other social networks. It has been too often that people I know have had disputes or privacy violations from unexpected account settings or public posts.
Although I enjoy sharing with my friends and family, I have often missed out because I do not appreciate the massively public experience that comes with the usual social networks. By creating a private social network, you can share what you want with who you want. 
The goal is to enable users to share with the people that actually cared about what they had to say.
The Project
Once I had the idea for Our Fridge, I was very excited to begin the planning stages of the app. The connected nature of the service, as well as the variety of platforms that would have to be developed for, provided a great opportunity to learn more about an assortment of technologies. 
Planning and developing has required a working knowledge of C#, Java, and Objective-C programming languages for the app platform, as well as the server-side scripting language, pHp. The full project has required:
Database server for shared data
Web/App server to provide connected functionality to the users
Mobile applications for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8
Web site for app information and various account functions
Network infrastructure. Allows for growth on the app server layer while persisting a common database and content delivery layer.
Since the idea of the app is to protect privacy and to securely store shared data, much of the developmental focus has been on data and communication encryption (using HTTPS and standard hashing and encryption algorithms),
While I have always felt confident in my abilities to plan and build the project, the actual development work has taught me so much. It has been an amazingly fun experience so far and I am excited to continue working to bring the idea to life.
While I have completed the development work by myself to this point, I have enlisted friends and family for various ideas as well as testing the builds as they became viable prototypes.
Status of the project
Currently, the Our Fridge mobile app is fully functional for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8. While there is work ahead to ensure the apps present an easy-to-use and enjoyable sharing experience, the major area of work lies in the server layer of the project. 
The app-server communication is very reliable in the testing done so far. Users have fast access to shared content and can quickly and efficiently share their own. 
Since the app-server communication is so key to the success of the project, it has become the major focus of development and need of funds. While the application performance remains strong at the current number of testers (~10), it is unlikely that the hosting service and structure will remain stable without improving the scalability of the server component of the app as well as upgrading the networking infrastructure.
 The software component of the app server can be made more efficient by relying less on dynamic content and instead introducing more statically defined components of the XML language used to communicate. Additionally, a more robust caching system to improve latency between request and response. These that can be improved on as I continue development.
I am currently utilizing the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform to provide hosting, load balancing, content storage, content delivery, and database services. Utilizing AWS allows us to grow the networking infrastructure as demand on also grows. Since it is an On Demand provider and enables auto-scaling, the infrastructure can start as small as needed, then can grow as large as needed.
The Budget
Since Amazon Web Services (AWS) will allow the service to grow dynamically in both size and costs. This will keep costs as small as possible while the demand is small and the infrastructure to grow as demand increases. This creates a budgetary need that is somewhat variable, but also the most important and expensive part of the project.
By allocating most of the funds to networking infrastructure, the budget for the project can remain obtainable while providing  great service.
Estimates for early demand put networking costs <$116/month (as per Amazon Web Services calculations). This amount will grow with demand and, with success, could grow very rapidly. If within the first year server costs grow to $220/month (a rather large web application), then the first 12 months of server costs will be <$2600. 
Additional network costs will include content delivery. Using dynamic web-based storage and a content delivery service (again through AWS), the costs will again be determined by the demand. The following amounts are very overestimated to ensure that the budget remains flexible.
At less than 300 GB of content delivered through the content deliver network: <$50/month
Storing less than  <300 of data: <$18/month
This will make up the vast majority of the budget.
Other costs will include:
$150 in app publishing fees ($100 for iOS, $20 for Google Play, $20 for Windows Phone)
$250/yr for SSL certificate registration (This enables HTTPS communication to encrypt user data.)
$15/yr for domain name registration
$50/hr for load testing the server component using Third-party software (Expected to use for up to 6hrs.)
This list, combined with hosting/networking/content delivery costs brings us to ~$4000 for at least 1 yr of service. This covers scenarios that include very high demand of the application and stress on the networking infrastructure. As such, this budget is relatively flexible and should not be a challenge to workaround.
The Conclusion
This project description has been a bit lengthy, but I am very excited to present it and am eager to see it come to life. I have been using the app amongst my friends for ~1 month and it has been great to be able to share in a private, secure way. This has been so much fun developing and working through and I hope that everyone else can enjoy using it.
While this project has started as a learning experience, I think that we can make it into a fully realized service for everyone to share without compromising privacy. 
We are building  the worlds first intergalctic private social media network.  In doing this we need to stop the trend of the larger networks creating the reality that selling your information is the only way you can have a social network.  We have completed the first phase of the network by creating the app OSo.  But we still have a lot to do and we want to add many more options and features that will allow for complete control and privacy of ones data.  Help us by pledging what ever you can and be apart of The Next Generation of Social Media!
By pledging to our project you are saying alot about how the future of Social Media should be.  We will give you an exclusive invite to our Beta that is currenty being tested as well.  
Thanks for your support and tell your friends and famiy to come help support us as well.  We look forward to freeing the social realm for the next generation of users and building The First Intergalactic Private Social Network.
OK...so maybe one day it will be intergalactic but for now the world is in need.  So lets Build It!!  OSo is here!

Important Update: The installer and application are now signed by trusted certificates. Also, the website now features an EV SSL certificate.
What?
What is Sovereign Share? Think of all the things you send to friends, family or business partners over the internet; emails, pictures, links, financial information, contracts, etc. Now imagine you sent all of those things through snail-mail without an envelope. Anyone along the way can see it all! Sovereign Share wraps your data in a virtual envelope that only the intended recipient can open.
Sovereign Share is a software solution that brings extremely strong encryption to the masses. It utilizes a proprietary encryption protocol that leverages a combination of proven encryption algorithms. Basically, it's the easiest and strongest way to protect your privacy when sending a message or a file. 
Do both users need an account? Yes. Sovereign Share requires that both users have a Sovereign Share account. 
Does this replace my email? No. Keep your gmail, yahoo or whatever account. The Sovereign Share software allows you to type a message or choose a file to encrypt, and gives you back a encrypted, protected file to send to the recipient.
How do I send the encrypted file? You could use the convenient Dropbox integration, attach the encrypted file to an email, put it on a thumb drive, send it via carrier pigeon or whatever you are comfortable with.
What do I do if someone sends me an encrypted file? Just open the Sovereign Share software and it will guide you through decrypting the file you received to it's original format in a few clicks. Maybe it's a word document, a picture, a spreadsheet, a message... whatever it is that you received, you will be able to open it normally on your computer after it is decrypted. 
What does this software really do for me? It gives you ultimate control over the data you need to send to someone else. For example: If you wanted to send a picture of your kids to a family member, but really really really didn't want someone else to be able to intercept it, you would encrypt it using the Sovereign Share software first. Now that picture is completely protected even if it is intercepted or stolen. Of course, there are many more serious use cases like a whistle-blower needing to send information to a journalist. Above and beyond the encryption, it allows you to specify a self-destruct date/time on a file, revoke access to a file from anywhere in the world and revoke access to a stolen device from anywhere in the world.
Why?
As it currently stands, anything you send over the internet can be intercepted and viewed by a third party - even if you are using "https"! See this link: http://bit.ly/1egSia2.
The answer to this question is becoming more and more obvious with each revelation regarding the erosion of our privacy. Unless you have been living under a rock, you know as well as I do that an easy to use, totally secure software solution is needed to send private messages or files to friends, family or business partners. This is exactly that solution.
Can I try it?
Yes. Anyone who makes a donation - no matter how small or large - will be given a private beta key to register on https://sovereignshare.com (or, you can use http://eyesoffmydata.com which will redirect you to the previous link). Get some friends involved and try it out!
Do I need this?
Businesses: Definitely. It was leaked that business information is being monitored by the NSA in some cases. Also, cyber crime is an ever growing threat and if you are not encrypting sensitive information, it is low hanging fruit for nefarious characters.
Individuals: I think so! Ultimately that is up to you. We all need to make holistic changes to the way we interact with technology. As it stands, the data that represents each of us online can paint an incredibly detailed picture of who we are. On principle alone, we should all be using encryption to thwart the government's unconstitutional efforts to undermine our privacy.
Who are you?
I am a software engineer, technical architect and development manager at an international marketing agency. I work on enterprise level solutions that require a high level of security and exceed industry standards. I find the government's abuse of power disgusting and disturbing which is why I hope you will help me make encryption ubiquitous. 
What stage is this project in?
So far I have a fully functional Windows client (beta) that allows users to send secure, private messages or files to their trusted contacts. That is already an incredible milestone and represents countless hours of time. The funding will be used to further test and harden the Windows client, develop clients for OSX (Mac), Android and iOS, as well as sourcing other talented security professionals to further harden the infrastructure. These additional clients will be rolled out over the next year. If Sovereign Share is successful long term, a great deal of effort will be placed in implementing a post-quantum cryptosystem. Currently quantum computing hasn't scaled up to be able to crack modern asymmetrical encryption, however, the NSA has committed over 70 million dollars to make it happen. If they are successful, all modern cryptosystems (SSL, PGP and others) will be compromised (http://wapo.st/1deblQm).
Feel free to log bugs or request features @ https://sovereignshare.fogbugz.com
How does it work?
Keep in mind that all of these technical details are entirely invisible to you, the user. The application and website are setup to be very easy to use.
First, this entire process is anonymous. We don't require an email address and you can use anything as a username. Your data or message is encrypted using 256bit encryption twice. The second time, the symmetric key is double encrypted (SSL and AES256/RSA4096) and transmitted to the server along with a random unique id for the encrypted data. This makes the data protected by keys stored in two separate locations. One without the other would be useless and only the recipient, on their specific device, can unlock both keys. In the unlikely event your computer is stolen, just login to the Sovereign Share website and revoke that device's access rendering the keys inaccessible. In the unlikely event the Sovereign Share server is hacked, the keys are encrypted at rest and completely useless without your physical device. If you are extra paranoid, you can even specify an auto-destruct date and time that the key will be destroyed.
A picture (or a few pictures) is (are) worth a thousand words. Check out these flow diagrams that outline the encryption protocol at a high level.

https://sovereignshare.com/content/images/SecureEncryptionMethod_DecryptionProcess.jpg
Rewards
Sovereign Share will be available as a subscription service - infrastructure (servers, people, enhancements, etc) cost money. The modest subscription fee will cover these basic costs. Again, the point is to make this accessible, not expensive. Some of the rewards include this subscription for a period of time, or, if you are a Chief Privacy Advocate, you get a very long subscription(Kickstarter does not allow lifetime subscriptions as rewards) for you and a few friends.

Why?
Why do people need these boxes? Simple, because there is no other good way to truly disconnect from high tech life and we all need to disconnect from time to time. This is an idea thats time has come. Everyone has their own reasons for wanting to be connected or disconnected, with the Faraday Box, we put each individual back in control. 
How is this better than ‰ÛÏairplane" mode or putting a phone on silent? 
Another easy answer. If you have ever used silent mode or airplane mode then you have also, at some point, forgotten to turn it off again. We hate that! The Faraday Box is easy, there are no settings to change or remember. In the box - no communication, out of the box - back to normal. Plus, while in the box all your other functions still work, allowing you to capitalize on many of the modern conveniences your phone provides. You can still utilize functions such as reminders, alarms, etc. to keep you on schedule, wake you up, remind you it's your mother's birthday‰Û_ whatever. The Faraday Box only suppresses communications and tracking, giving you true privacy when, where, and if you choose. 
This is a pre-production model. Rewards will be slightly different. Still working on how the top will close in the production version.
We are excited to pursue this project and think it provides a real solution to a problem space where there are currently no realistic consumer solutions. The Faraday Boxes that are being offered as rewards are not the end goal of this project.  They represent the first in a line of consumer products all with the same goal, giving people real control and real privacy when, where, and if they want it.
How does it work? 
Any electronics inside the Faraday Box, when it is closed, will immediately and completely have all incoming and outgoing communications severed. Not to worry, when the box is opened again all communications are restored. No phone service, WiFi, BlueTooth, GPS, or any other communication or tracking signal can be received or sent from a phone inside the Faraday Box. The Faraday Box is based on a well known concept in electrical engineering called a Faraday cage. The math gets hairy, but the concept is simple, no electronic signals can penetrate this box. 
Who would buy one?
We think everyone would benefit from having this type of control over their lives. But selling to ‰ÛÏeveryone‰Û is tough and probably a bad marketing strategy. We believe this will immediately appeal to business professionals, school teachers, doctors, individuals looking for a good way to disconnect and ‰ÛÏpreppers‰Û (for a different reason, that I will get to in a bit). I can easily see having a Faraday Box in a meeting room or business office. When the meeting starts, phones go in the box. This completely eliminates the chance of any phones ringing in the middle of an important presentation or meeting. How about a school classroom setting? A phone is a great way to make sure your children get where they are headed, but when they get to class, phones go in the box, and all electronic distractions are eliminated. No worries, text and phone messages will be waiting for them when the box is opened and the phone reconnects. If you NEED to call your child in the middle of the day, use the proper channel and call the school. And for the security minded, no remote enabling or disabling to record conversation is possible while in a Faraday Box either.
This brings us to the ‰ÛÏpreppers‰Û. We added a larger version of the Faraday Box to the rewards to better serve the needs of this community.  To truly protect backup electronics from an electromagnetic (EM) burst you will want a product that is professionally designed and that is capable of providing visible feedback so you know it is working properly (the Faraday Box has a see through top). Stop putting stuff in metal trash cans or wrapping it in foil because a friend of a friend said it would work. Everything else about the "prepper" mindset is to eliminate chance. Using those old methods is called hoping for the best‰Û_ having a Faraday Box is called being prepared.  
With a mesh top (all models) it is easy to see that your phone is completely disconnected. Watch a demo at the end of the Kickstarter video.
With a formal education and real world experience in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) it is clear that  achieving a complete electromagnetic seal using just some foil is harder than one might think.
Production and order fulfillment
A portion of the funding received from backers will be used to purchase the necessary equipment to build the Faraday Boxes. As we do not currently own a fabrication business, we will build these ourselves. If there is an overwhelmingly positive response (a lot of people back the project) we will team with a local shop to construct the boxes so everyone will receive their rewards in a timely fashion. Most likely, only one of the above will occur. Either the production volume will be something we can handle, or it will be contracted to a local shop for construction, either way the Faraday Boxes WILL be built in the USA (regardless of possible profit margin increases by having them made overseas). We anticipate being able to build about 100 boxes a week (see the risk section for more details).  Given the number of rewards it will take to fund the project (~100 depending on which rewards are chosen), the prospect of a January 2014 delivery for the early bird specials is very likely and a February delivery of the rest also seems very likely.  If overfunded, we will do our best to deliver high quality units as fast as possible.
We are already looking ahead, trying to anticipate the wants and needs of our customers.  Below is an example of a VERY rough prototype of a metal screen pouch.  As part of the $10 reward you can help us decide if this is the right direction for future products.  Or, maybe you would prefer a smaller flatter "desk drawer" size box. There are a lot of posibilities but none of them will happen without your support.  
Already at work on possible future products. We know this isn't pretty but this is a first draft, first we make it work, then we make it pretty! Backers at the $10 level will have influence on this and other future products.

Access Anywhere
OneSafe Basic is free and will always be free. Contributors will get early access to OneSafe Basic and early access to OneSafe Pro or Ultimate with a discounted rate.
With our Beta1 release of OneSafe, we received responses from hundreds of people who were excited about our vision of empowering every cloud user to secure and protect their personal data. We‰Ûªve been working day and night to improve our product based on this feedback. To support millions of users accessing their public cloud storage securely and reliably, we simply need more resources. By raising money through crowd funding, we can focus entirely on removing the frictions of using public cloud storage for normal users while protecting the security of their data.
With our security there will be governments, corporations, and other entities that will no longer be able to censor, spy and exploit the data that you put into the cloud. If you believe in our vision, that everyone has the right to privacy in their digital world, and you want to help us bring this technology to the general public then help us fight for those rights. Everyone should have the ability to control their privacy. Stand together with us by donating and helping us meet our fundraising goal.
The first $50,000 will help us finish product engineering, server acquisition and the support we need for our coming release. OneSafe Pro paid service will provide advanced services to all users and help the sustainability of OneSafe. It will take much longer to reach a finished product without your support. Your support will give us the ability to act faster and to build a stronger support system to guarantee service quality and sustainability.

                                                         I have questions, how can I reach your team? 
For anything related to the campaign or to OneSafe in general reach out to us at support@onesafe.io.
What happens to my account after the campaign expires? 
We‰Ûªll migrate payments to our new system after the campaign expires. There will not be any service disruption during this migration. 
Is OneSafe Free? 
Basic access is free forever. Premium access, which includes additional features, costs a monthly fee. For more details visit www.OneSafe.io/pricing.shtml 
Alright, really. How secure is OneSafe? 
Nothing is a guarantee in life but OneSafe takes every effort possible to ensure that only you can access your secure data. This is done by ensuring that unencrypted data never leaves your machine before it is encrypted. Additionally, only the user has access to their encryption passphrase. OneSafe has zero-knowledge about your passphrase or your data. So even if our servers are ever compromised, your data remains safe.  
How is OneSafe funded so far? 
We are entirely self-funded by our founders. 
Why should I pledge? 
If you believe in user privacy then pledge. As the internet becomes more intertwined with our daily lives we need to ensure there are strong safeguards in place to protect our most sensitive information. Companies like ours are the tip of the spear in protecting users online and we need your support. 
Other than contributing, how can I help? 
If you aren‰Ûªt interested in donating but still believe in internet privacy help out organizations like the EFF.
What happens if you guys shut down? Do I lose my data? 
The short answer is NO. Even if our service is shutting down, our promise to our users is that we will give ample warning (2 months or more) to our users so they have time to decrypt and move their encrypted data.
What happens if you guys are hacked? 
OneSafe does not have the master key needed to decrypt and look at your data. So even we are hacked, your files will not possibly leak to anyone, and your privacy is still protected. However, we are doing our best by using industry standard to protect our system from compromising.
What is Privacy?
Privacy will be a secure way to protect your data before sharing it or uploading it to cloud services.  Our main objectives for this app are as follows:
Strong and Safe: uses industry-standard encryption to protect your data.  Share or back up with confidence.
Simple and Easy to Use: intuitive design that doesn't get in the way.
For Every Device: Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, Linux...
Completely Free: no ads, no spywayre, no nags.  Just Privacy.
Privacy: My Story
by Joe Skeen
We live in the golden age of the cloud.  Never has there been more free ways to back up your data, access it from any device, and protect it from being lost due to computer failure or natural disasters. (For example, Dropbox gives you 2 GB free, iCloud and Amazon Cloud Drive give you 5 GB, and both Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive give you a whopping 15 GB of free storage, just to name a few.)  But we all know that convenience comes with a price. Every day, around the world, there are people trying to hack into businesses and steal data.  Big corporations are not immune to these threats, as we hear about another company being hacked almost every week.  I don't know about you, but each time I hear about another cyberattack on a big company, it makes my stomach turn.  I wonder what is happening to my private data, and I wonder who will be hit next.
So, I have a dilemma. I see great value in being able to store my documents on the cloud and access them anywhere, but I am worried that they won't keep private, either because of hackers or because the company keeping my data is using my data for their own purposes.  Should I, for instance, back up my tax documents to the cloud, or is that just identity theft waiting to happen?
This issue has been on my mind for several years now, since a wise professor of mine from Neumont University posed the question, "Who is going to secure the cloud?" Any measures that companies use to keep your data safe are all hinging on the hopes that they won't get hacked.  I decided that the only way to keep my data safe is to take my personal privacy into my own hands, and that is when Privacy was born.
About a year ago, I became obsessed with the idea of protecting my data, and began working during any spare moment I could find, which mostly ended up being during my commute on the train or bus.  Within a couple of months I had created a script that would take a file and encrypt it using AES.  It wasn't pretty, and it didn't use the best security practices, but it did work, and I was proud of my accomplishment.
About the same time, I had passed the certification exam to become a Xamarin certified mobile developer.  Xamarin is a set of tools that allows you to share the same app code across the major computing platforms (Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows). I saw this as an opportunity to make this protection available to everyone, regardless of technical ability, device, or budget, and to keep the code in sync to make it easier to maintain and update.
Over the past several months, I have talked with many people, and feel that this is something that could benefit everyone.  I hope that you feel the same way, and will contribute whatever you can to help improve and finish this project, and make the world a better and safer place.
What Privacy Does
The first fundamental purpose of Privacy is to be a safe and secure way to protect your data, so that it can be stored in the cloud or shared with those you trust without your privacy being compromised. I believe that one person can never create a secure system alone, and as more people are involved, more ideas are shared, and more defects are discovered.  Nothing would be worse than to release security software with inherent security flaws, and that is why we are committed to consulting with experienced security and cryptography experts throughout the development process to ensure that your privacy will be protected.  Someday, after our costs have been covered, I would also like to open source the app, to make it possible for more security-minded individuals to contribute to the improvement of the software.
The second fundamental purpose is to be as simple, unobtrusive, and easy to use as possible.  Many encryption apps I have seen or used have been designed for power users and aren't very friendly to the average user.  Most of the time when I mention encryption to any of my non-technical friends, they immediately stop listening, thinking that you have to be nerdy to use or care about it. I want to change that perception by making data protection a seamless experience.  For example, files can be protected using drag and drop or from the context menu in the file browser.  When you open a protected file, it will automatically launch the correct program once the file has been decrypted (such as opening the default PDF viewer for a protected PDF).  If the app is easy to use, it is more likely that the average user will use it.
The third and final focus of this app is cross-platform availability and consistency.  If I use Privacy to send you a protected file, I don't want to have to worry about what device or operating system you are using when you receive it.  In order for Privacy to be useful to anyone, it must be available to everyone for free.  I am willing to sacrifice a great deal of time, effort, and money to give this to everyone, and that will not be cheap.
Your contribution to our Kickstarter project will help us to get licenses to the tools we need to build our software for every device, consult with security experts, and get appropriate cryptographic certificates to protect our app's identity so you can trust this app completely.  The world needs an app like this, and I need your help to make it happen.  Please contribute to our project today.

I have been writing software most of my life.  When I was eight years old, I started using some of my dad's development tools that were installed on our family computer.  I loved being able to create something that could be shared and enjoyed by others.  Over the next several years, I taught myself Pascal, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, and dabbled in a few other languages.
Attending Neumont University changed the way I thought about software construction and gave me experience in more object oriented languages, including Java, C#, and C++.  Since graduating as co-valedictorian, I have had a broad industry experience, developing software for banking, security, and healthcare.  Everyone that knows me professionally would agree that I am driven and take pride in my work.  I am always looking for ways to learn and improve my skill and craft as a software developer.  
I am committed to making the Privacy app be the most secure and solid software I have ever created.  Please give me that chance.
Early beta testing results
Have you noticed your computer getting slower recently?
Are you frustrated with advertisers targeting you endlessly?
Ad-Less: Enjoy More!
    As a programmer, father, and fellow Internet user, I am tired of the increasing intrusiveness of the methods used to steal our information. What happens when advertisements turn on us? Many of us are unwilling to give our most basic information to local businesses. Yet, we freely allow strangers online to steal our most intimate details. That‰Ûªs why I created Ad-Less. The mission of Ad-Less is to level the playing field and give you back control over your Internet experience.
    Advertising is big business. As a result, many professionals are following the dollar signs or selling out by producing crippled ‰ÛÏad block‰Û solutions. What the community needs is an advocate that knows the system and can help defend against this increasing online epidemic without compromise. Every minute, the technology used to steal our information is growing stronger, while the software to defend against it grows more obsolete. Before long, every intimate detail of your life will be collected, processed, and sold to the highest bidder.
    Since working in the software field for many years, I have been troubled by the ease with which companies, and amateurs alike, are able to access intimate information about our daily lives, then share your profile with advertising companies to monetize the situation. I have been developing Ad-Less as my contribution to help keep the Internet safe. That is why I am offering it absolutely FREE!
Every revolution needs resources!
    I am passionate about offering Ad-Less to the world, and I have devoted every resource at my disposal to get it off the ground. Your contribution will help cover the additional funding needed to make Ad-Less a reality and allow us to release Ad-Less as a free download to the personal consumers like yourself as the most sophisticated Ad-Blocker yet!

When I have Angela Merkel phones had a bug, and when I have seen House of Card series, I told to myself why everybody has not the right to talk freely and privately. After some government started filtering VOIP applications, I told to myself even unsecured version has a lot of usage, so a secured version is definitely a need.
NoGap creates a Public/Private key pair for each user. The public key would be shared with community. Using symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, it provides a secure channel to transmit voice and text of users. NoGap uses the same algorithm that US Government uses for its Top Secret communications. Our servers would not be able to decode the communication, even all servers in the world would need 8 years to decrypt the communication.
I thought about that idea for a while, and talked to few people. People who I talked with agreed that it might be useful to have such tool. There are a lot of VoiceOverIP mobile apps, but most of them would not provide such a function. 
I have designed a two way encryption for this app:
Users would upload their public keys to public server upon registration. They would have the option to update their key-pair as the want.
When they want to establish a voice connection, they will receive the public key of the other party from server. 
When the VOIP connection established, they will use the other party private key to communicate the voice to other channel:
NoGap is almost ready to be available in the market. I have been working on this project for the last 12 months. I still need to manage the design and artistic side of it. I have created a KickStarter campaign to retrieve feedback of users and their support. It would be a great help if you could could take a look at the KickStarter page and let me have your opinion.
VIP Service
The use of secured private line for voice/text communication would be free to everybody. However, for people that may have more concerns and want to have better voice quality, a VIP servers would be available. 
The VIP servers would have less traffic, and provides a better voice quality,

Summary:
A quick background for those unfamiliar with TOR. TOR is a tool used to enhance privacy and anonymity on the internet. It does this by encrypting and sending your internet traffic through multiple servers on the TOR Network before exiting to the open internet. Journalists use TOR to communicate with sources and conduct their research in Private. Dissidents use TOR to communicate outside the prying eye of their governments. TOR allows Whistleblowers to expose corruption safely. In extremely oppressive regimes, TOR literally saves lives. Behind the "Great Firewall of China" or the "Halal Internet" TOR allows people to bypass government censorship guaranteeing their open access to information. More Detailed Information available at: https://www.torproject.org/
The Problem:
There has always been some question as to the integrity of TOR Exit Nodes, so called "Bad Onions" or "Hostile Exit nodes". Leviathan Security just recently uncovered a TOR exit node manipulating user downloads to install malware. Hostile governments could use these methods to potentially identify the user or give them complete control over the users system. Cyber criminals could use this to pilfer passwords and bank account information, create Botnets, etc. Some recent articles highlighting the issue:
Leviathan - The case of Modified Binaries
TOR PROJECT Flags Exit node delivering Malware
The Solution:
The primary goal is simple, to provide an increased level of assurance to TOR users that they are not using a hostile TOR Exit node. The primary goals of this project are to:
1. Proactively review TOR exit notes to identify "Bad Onions", exit nodes that may be hostile to the TOR user population. This would be done using some of the existing methods highlighted in the articles above, elsewhere,  and by developing new methods.
2. Establish a reputation system allowing users to better determine which Exit node may suit them best and which to watch out for.
3. Develop a TOR Browser plugin that that will display the reputation of the EXIT node being used. Making it clear to the user if they're using a safe node or one suspected of hostile activity.
4. Create additional "high reputation" TOR Exit nodes as funding allows.
We are planning to unveil new features like Live Chatroom and Instant location deals, and add updates to the user interface. Live chatroom will allow real-time interaction with users in the vicinity. Instant deals are geolocation based digital coupons to use at point of sale. For example, if you are near your favorite coffee shop and they are promoting a deal, that deal will show in the Pximity app as a digital coupon or reward to redeem instantly. 
Thank you for all of your support.
We knew this would not be easy and we knew Kickstarter was not the ideal platform to raise the money we needed to developer a human-readable privacy policy.
We are not giving up but we are scaling back the project. For the time being we will be focusing on building human-readable privacy policies of popular online services to encourage user trust and increase privacy awareness.
We are going to begin this phase with the launch of the Facebook Human-Readable Privacy Policy in the coming weeks. We will also launch a donation button on our website (khulaproject.com) to fund some of the basic needs of the project (e.g. web hosting, basic office expanses‰Û_). While we will be working at a slower pace we will continue to move forward with the project.
We hope you will stay with us as we keep working to make privacy easier to understand online.
Thank you again for all of your support during the project.
P.S. The easiest way to stay up-to-date with our progress is to subscribe to our email newsletter on khulaproject.com
Over the past year there has been an avalanche of privacy issues, from LinkedIn‰Ûªs use of profile photos in advertising to Facebook‰Ûªs seemingly never-ending privacy troubles.  Privacy problems destroy users‰Ûª confidence and bring complicated restrictions to online services.
We know nearly all of these issues could be completely avoided with a clear understanding of the privacy policies at work. This is where the Khula Project comes.
Our solution is to create a clear and concise human-readable privacy policy that will translate the complex and confusing legal language into plain English that we can all understand.
Why We Are Building Khula
Human-readable policies clearly outline the key terms of the excessively complex and lengthy legal jargon of the full policy.
Human-readable policies were popularized by Creative Commons in their quest to revolutionize and simplify copyright law. Creative Commons created a set of clear copyright licenses to foster simple free sharing of copyrighted work, and used a human-readable license deed to clearly explain the key terms to users.
We are using human-readable policies to clearly explain the core privacy issues affecting users across the web. Our human-readable policies will go beyond the simple task of explaining the key terms of privacy policies. With our human-readable policies, users will gain confidence through the knowledge of how services are using and sharing information.
Knowledge is power and through our Human-Readable Privacy Policy we are empowering the user to dictate how their information is shared and used online. We are not, however, trying to create walls between services and user information. There is no ‰Û÷one size fits all‰Ûª for user privacy and information usage. For public services like Twitter, users have the expectation that nearly everything they do is public, whereas with private services such as financial sites, users demand complete privacy.
Privacy should not be a complicated issue.
 What We Are Building
Khula Project consists of two products being developed over three phases.
Our products:
Hand-built Human-Readable Privacy Policy; we are creating hand-built human-readable privacy policies in two parts: 
1.       We will be creating hand-built human-readable policies for our backers at the $150 level or higher. These policies will be tailored to the service‰Ûªs specific needs. We will also work with our backers to address any potential privacy issues.
2.       We will build human-readable privacy policies for many popular web services to demonstrate the benefits of a clear and concise privacy policy and to understand how privacy issues are affecting the various sectors of web services.
Human-Readable Privacy Policy Creator; is an online tool we are developing to allow services to easily create human-readable policies. Services will be able to customize their policy based on a number of factors to ensure the human-readable policy is tailor made to their needs.
Privacy Policy Files; while we are immensely encouraging services to prominently display their human-readable privacy policies to gain confidence in their users among other benefits, we will also create a central database where users can search and examine services privacy policies.
Our Kickstarter fundraising will enable us to build the first three phases of the Khula Project;
Phase 1 will create human-readable privacy policies of popular web services. These human-readable policies will assist us in identifying the key terms and core issues surrounding users‰Ûª privacy online. We are currently in this phase.
Phase 2 will expand to include our backers at the $150 level and higher. Thank you for all of your support! We will work with our backers to create a tailor-made human-readable privacy policy to fit their specific needs. During this phase we will also be looking to our entire group of backers to help shape and define our human-readable privacy policies and to ensure users‰Ûª privacy concerns are addressed. Our human-readable privacy policies will not just cover what is in the legal code of the services privacy policy but will also examine whether the service is working in the best interest of their users.
Phase 3 is our final objective for our Kickstarter fundraising. We will construct our Human-Readable Privacy Policy Creator to foster the simple creation of human-readable policies across the internet. Our backers will be integral in shaping, testing, designing, and perfecting our Human-Readable Privacy Policies at every phase. Our backers are the driving forces that will make this project happen. Backers at the $29 level and higher will receive first access to our human-readable privacy policy creator and will be the first field testers. In addition, if we reach our 1,000 backer goal, every backer will receive early access to our Creator regardless of their pledge amount.
Thank you for all of your support. We are building this for you and without your help we cannot make this happen.
Where the Money Goes
Our Kickstarter objective is $14,000. After Kickstarter‰Ûªs fees and taxes there will be roughly $12,000 for our project‰Ûªs expenses. $14,000 is not our final goal, but the bare minimum amount we need to cover the expenses to build our human-readable privacy policies. These do not include our personal expenses; such as the overrated act of eating or paying rent which they seem to need every month.
Any amount above the $14,000 we raise will go directly to the project to expand our focus and move quicker. We are building this project no matter what, but it will be significantly harder, slower, and smaller without your help. It is only with your help that we can transform the Khula Project from a hobby to an impactful evolution of web services.
Below is a rundown of our Kickstarter objective and an overview of the funding process.
Thank you again for all of your help during our project and please don‰Ûªt forget to spread the word. Spreading the word about what we are all doing here is just as valuable as your financial contribution.
Rewards
Startup Sponsor Program
There is a massive ocean of diverse startups and while we would love to build personal human-readable privacy policies for every single one of them, it is unfeasible due to time constraints. That is why we have started the Startup Sponsor Program.
At the $500 level and higher, backers are able to sponsor human-readable privacy policies for specific startups or sponsor a policy for a startup in need. Each sponsored policy will be personally built and tailor made for the specific startup. We will also give personal feedback on the startup‰Ûªs privacy policy and be there if they have any questions.
At the $500 level backers can sponsor up to four of their human-readable privacy policies while at the $1,000 level backers have 2 special sponsor policies that give the startups the same great support that our backers get. Additional sponsor policies can be added by simply including an extra $75 to your pledge.
We will begin taking applications for startups in need of a human-readable privacy policy at the end of our Kickstarter fundraising.

We have started a project launching open souce code for individual privacy and security from mass surveillence programs and hacking. So far, we have a search engine (Cekpet search- that demonstrates the uses of punycode, and filenames with special characters to block against vulnerability scanners, pen testing software, and ddos software), a tor exit bridge (tadisdef.ml- which allows people using tor to use sites with the torblock extension), and a google chrome extension (zxxeverywhere- which adds the zxx font to all pages you visit in order to block screenshot and character recognition software).
The next stage is developing the plugins and extensions for all browsers and hosting services so all the software can be easily used by everyone (this means plugins for wordpress and extensions for all browsers- chrome is done). As well as an online resource for (non-intrusive) testing your website for common vulnerabilities. All money raised will go to hosting, ssl certificates for all projects, development costs, and distribution costs so it can remain free and open source for everyone.
Our sites are listed in the Free Software Foundation Directory and has been recognized by independent news sources. All methods have been tested, as seen in the images below.
 ^These images show the sites being tested with two separate vulnerability scanners. 
We will use the funding to help finish the development of the all new Convertible TVHat. With this funding we will be able to test more compatible phone models to provide a intrinsic compatibility list. We will also test the hat with major sport branded visor hats to ensure that your favorite hat will function with the Convertible TVHat.

The theft of consumer data has hit epic proportions!  
Data breaches have become so wide spread that they have finally hit main street.  With the latest stories surrounding Target, Neiman Marcus and PF Chang's it's clear the consumer isn't safe when using credit or debit cards.  "Let the Buyer Beware" has Taken on a Whole New Meaning.
How is a consumer to know what merchants are safe and take the safety and security of their customers financial and personal information safely?  Merchants haven't been very transparent or forthcoming with their data security strategies.
Up until recently there was no way!  Now with PrivacyAtlas consumers can check on the data security of over 40,000 merchants.  The number of merchants is growing daily and PrivacyAtlas currently boasts the only repository of merchant data.
PrivacyAtlas is receiving great press, being featured in Consumer Reports, Forbes.com and on FOX and NBC News Nationwide.  But our goal is to now make every consumer in North America aware of this valuable tool that is freely available to them to use as often as they like.
With the funds we receive from this campaign we will produce a quality advertisement that will be aired nationwide.  Additionally we will use the funds to continue to add merchant data to our ever growing database.
PrivacyAtlas is an advocate for the protection of consumer information!  It provides a valued service that is being met with rave reviews. 
Security is hard. We want to make it easy for everyone to use best practices in the protection of their data and privacy.
Gymyli's LOC provides a technical solution to a political problem: namely, warrant-less spying by government agencies. As Americans and believers in the Rights afforded by our Constitution, we are appalled by the erosion of the rights of privacy afforded by the 1st, 4th and 5th Amendments and we further believe that all peoples everywhere should enjoy these same protections against unreasonable search and the suppression of free speech.
We bring our 20 years of Internet security expertise to bear on the challenge of providing to a non-technical audience an easy to implement, easy to use virtual private server to provide personal cloud services to you beyond the watchful eye of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo, and Apple, your ISP, LEOs, and spy agencies.
Your LOC secure private server provides:
Secure email hosting. 
Secure storage. 
VPN Services. 
Anonymous surfing
Strong, end-to-end encryption
 The solution is designed as an undesirable target for hackers and spy agencies by providing a high difficulty, low ROI target for their efforts. Gaining access to one person's data is not the success model hackers and spy agencies are currently enjoying as they leverage targets like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Home Depot, Target, JPMorgan/Chase (to name a few). Specifically, we incorporate the following goals in design and development: 
 A tiny attack surface with limited attack vectors 
Resilient software, automatically and continuously patched as new vulnerabilities are discovered 
Intrusion detection to alert the user of attempted breaches 
Comprehensive audit and access controls 
No path for hosting vendor to breach system security to gain access to your data 
Limited or no logging of service activity 
Gymyli LOC is a virtual machine, built on open source software, hardened to Center for Internet Security Benchmark standards and beyond, running in Amazon's cloud. The domain is yours, the services are yours and the keys to the kingdom are yours and yours alone. 
Gymyli LOC provides summary emails to you about all activity on your system so you know if nefarious activity is being attempted. 
We will use these funds to further our development progress and to make the process of creating a maximum security environment for your data and communications very user-friendly, lowering the technical bar for the user to take control of their online life. We will also make it possible for Gymyli to run with other virtual infrastructure providers around the world. 
We will provide training to you, our user, to achieve a high level of security on your local machines from which you will VPN into your Personal Cloud to utilize the
Email server  
File storage 
Anonymous web browsing 
All with full, end-to-end STRONG encryption to which you, and ONLY you, hold the keys. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
Sharing Content In Messaging Apps
Ever notice how many times you have to exit your messaging application in the middle of a conversation to copy text from your email, copy content from another application, grab a screen shot of a map showing your location or have to remember a phone number or address? Ever notice that that content becomes stagnant requiring you to go back again and again to update your conversations? Annoying, right? We at Whiteboard call this "app flipping" and we believe this friction reduces the usefulness of today's messaging applications.
Whiteboard Lets Content Stay Alive In Your Conversation
Whiteboard is a new kind of application, built specifically around accessing and collaborating on content from directly within the application. With Whiteboard you will be able to share and have conversations around airline flights, stock prices, sports scores, Dropbox files, Tweets, LinkedIn posts, cloud applications, even your company's API enabled applications and much much more. No more app flipping!
Features
Notifications shows a feed of the latest activity across all of your Whiteboard conversations.
The conversation, or Whiteboard, is where you communicate with others in your group.
Sketch allows you to draw directly inside your conversation.
Keep track of the live content of a conversation all in one place.
Pricing
Whiteboard will initially come in a version for individuals and professionals priced at $1.99/year. Live content can be added as an in-app purchase priced from $0 up to $3.99, depending upon the content source. Free for easily sourced content found on the Internet and a little more for your business related content such as your CRM or sales applications.
Security
Whiteboard utilizes advanced peer-to-peer technologies and military grade security to ensure your conversations remain private. We don't store your messages on our servers to eliminate the risk of someone stealing your information.
Funding Goals
Our $5,000 goal will let us address the bare minimum feature set needed to release the first version. So far our team has made great progress and our developers have graciously donated their time to make this app a reality. We just need a little help to get it across the finish line.
With your financial support, we will be able to accelerate completion of the mobile app and configure the backend messaging application to enable us to release our first app store version in early 2015. We think we have good ideas, but we want feedback from you - an extended member of our team.
Rewards
All donations will give you periods of free service. Donations of over $10 will get you free stuff. Donations of over $25 will give you a say in what live content we enable in the app through a survey following the successful funding of the project. Of course, the content will need to be available from a reliable source. 
Not interested in donating now, but still want to be kept up to date? No problem, we're just glad you read this far! Head over to http://www.whiteboardllc.net and leave us your email address. We will keep you up to date on our progress and let you know when the app is ready.
Our Team
Between us we average more than 20 years of experience in the areas of mobile technologies, networking, security, application development, graphic design, business development and business operations working for Tier 1 consulting companies, telecommunications firms and web content publishers. We are excited to finally be bringing together all that experience to focus on Whiteboard and deliver the best possible app to you.

(private mac web browser) + (encrypted local programmable file vault) + (personal cloud VM) #wip
http://lolnub.com/bin/lolnub.app.zip
http://lolnub.com/bin/lolnub.pdf
Let's build and remix the web of tomorrow with modern day design and development but also while we're here, let's update the moral, privacy, and social models too so we can all help securely create on the future web!
Right now we need YOUR help to continue building out our functionally minded cloud app and file server + Mac Web Theme Park app (with optional encryption and future Story Attraction ;D). User-first privacy and security models being designed right here from the ground up.
Then we slam it all in a fun Adventurama style open source universe, with Clouds and Castles, Wizards, Bots, Items, Signals, and Nubspace and let people code it with an easy to code tweetable plain english commands (#hash @ping $signal) and embed all kinds of other cool stuff right there in the code just waiting to be explored by first time programmers.
Chapter 1: ilvmx.org
# ilvmx.org (entity server)
The ILM #lolnub multiverse is powered by the open source ILvMx. `internet love virtual magic exchange` server for creating functionally minded grid servers with long running Bots, Items, and Signals building and scraping your personal web with per-file entity programming 
*handwavy open source alpha code here* 
https://github.com/mphhh/ilvmx
tldr; imagine you can type regularish words into twitter and download an  entire social networks" or see entire news archives custom remixed just for you.
Fun(ctional) - Castles, Signals, Items, Bots, Wizards, and more, oh my!
Reactive - completely async signal (event), time, and step-based execution.
Code + Storage - global namespace of code + storage. 
Divinely Fast - default static object graphs because web servers love files.
Chapter 2: #lolnub (clients)
#lolnub alpha Mac client.
 Fun Parts! (aka the first ILvMx app)
## [lolnub.app](https://github.com/mphhh/lolnubapp) (open source Mac client)
#lolnub is the client portion of the triad. We have an `alpha level` Mac app now. iOS next. Fund the Kickstarter for Linux + Windows.
Create and share anonymous Nubspaces in seconds. aka programmable anonymous fun boards
Nubspaces are registration-optional and may be open to anyone, or, secure, private, and password-protected so that only those you share the password with may see and use them for passive chatting, longer talks and discussions, and/or sharing files personal files with each other.
Nubs are a great choice for instant new groups and sharing, while also working well as a "back channel" or private hub for established families and adventuring groups too.
Chapter 3: idksup.com
A truth engine for a happy life manual. 
Cash and Karma engine for whatever legal structure we democratically decide we want to use.
Our project's "for fun and profit non-profit" efforts.
#idksup endcaps a triad of new projects focused on the dark areas surrounding life today and the web of tomorrow. Our core beliefs are that you have the right to:
be secure and social or private 
publish freely
happily profit from your work
Although simple, these three concepts have a powerful effect on how we think, design, and develop ourselves in the world of tomorrow. Join us here and together we are going to build a knowledge base of street level life apps.
idksup.com 
Will be a place where users keep their own private Castle servers that are peers on the Ilvmx. network. Essentially, each hosted Castle (ilvmx/lib/castle/castle.ex) server will be a full cloned small droplet (or other VM) most likely running CoreOS/Docker so every subscribed user will have their own full private linux server running 24/7 (or magically scaled etc) in complete isolation as a selective peer of the network. 
This gives Ilvmx developers immense power because once we decide a package (eg. three.js, ecto.ex, mailpile, elm-lang, etc.) is going to be part of the platform, all Castle (CoreOS) server syncs, and immediately updates all Cakedown apps which are the ilvmx processes running the industry-proven Elixir/Erlang node. From then on, your Castle Reactively updates your Scenes (ilvmx/lib/magic/scene.ex) which propagate to the ilvmx galaxy/network and on into your lolnub.com client where the information may optionally be encrypted before hitting your disk chips.
Boom. Sounds neat huh? Incredibly complex websites that can easily be deployed and coded with plain ole js/html/css or native code passed down to your Docker instance. Since your each and every one of us are connected but exist in complete CoreOS isolation, we really start to care less about hostile code. As long as trust can be proven in a side channel, we're good right? I'm honestly not a crypto guy so a paid review would be nice to get.

Two years ago I had an eureka moment on a  proposed encryption algorithm. Today I have reached to the point where I can say that my idea is now a product. We have since built a website dedicated to the project basics-- www.skcjju256.com. The scientific and mathematical interpretations are presented as they were identified to be infallible at this point.
We humbly challenge anyone to prove us wrong. In the same vein. We are seeking support from you to make the system (skcjju256) implored in this brainchild application called 'Secure Text LokDon' much better. We believe that it is a game changer as there are more things one can do with it. We are hoping to increase the bits encrypted to 3072 with the keys capable of changing through an API update process.
We also have plans on the works for holding the keys secured in a chip on your device or computer. This plan will extend to a common device made from this chip allowing you to secure your local network and  internet data transfer with ease of confidentiality, security and integrity.
Once again, I am proposing with your support an extension of a system of dynamic key changing process in all human communications devoid any external influence. This will not only be limited to just software. This will put security of your data in your own hands.  To prove that it will worth you time; you are encouraged to check out the application on google play store: See for yourself what  our team have done. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inucoder.lokdon. Remember to complete the review form.
Thanks for your time.
Home Screen
Over three years ago I developed this application to control and schedule when I would accept calls and text messages.  It started due to being sick of  people reading the messages that popped up on the face of my phone. Since that time, a number of apps have been developed and smartphone operating systems have come out with some, but not all, of these features.  None of these phones or applications are protected nearly as well as mine nor have a patent.
I also hated being in a meeting or a negotation and having my notifications keep popping up risking incoming info being seen by a competitor, yet I didn't want to have to turn off my phone or put it away while waiting for a critical phone call or updates.  
Profile
So with this app I was able to control who could contact me and when they did.  I no longer needed to worry about what would be seen if I just left my phone out and it got "snooped".
schedule
In the end it made me stop hating my phone.  No more drama over old girlfriends texting without needing to blocking them completely or Drunk Dials at 3 am. However, I can still keep my calls and texts coming in from the people I care about on my "Approved VIP Anytime List" and still get them normally. 
It really is this simple.  If you want a call or text you get it.  If you do not want it visible, it goes into a double password protected folder you can check on your own terms.  
settings
I applied for a patent on this and it was recently granted (after the three year process) and it has already been referenced in other patent applications.  
Patent application title: TEMPORAL INCOMING COMMUNICATION NOTIFICATION MANAGEMENT
Inventors:  Peter J. Lynch, Iii (Fredericksburg, VA, US)

My goal is to finish the products features for all MMS, SMS and Phone calls on any android based phone.  
At this time the app will not work with Apple products and we hope to figure away around Apple's developmental limitations. Please be aware that we are not offering this product for Apples at this time.  This product is Only for Androids and have I no expectations of when an Apple product will, if ever, be presented to market.
My partner and I are both US retired and service-disabled veterans who have devoted our lives to ensuring the safety of our fellow citizens. We also have over 60 years of combined experiences in collecting, handling, storing, and protecting information.  We fully understand the ramifications of someone inadvertently or intentionally compromising or exploiting sensitive information. We also view information privacy as an inalienable right that requires protection everywhere on Google Earth.
Since our retirements, we have dedicated ourselves to developing information privacy practices, processes, and technological solutions aimed at protecting the information privacy rights of people globally. We believe that every individual has a right to communicate privately and we want to provide them with this capability.   We also believe they should have access to cost-effective, reliable, and secure privacy enhancing technologies.
We believe "Privacy Legion" will provide individuals with a secure means to text safely without fear of unwarranted compromise or intrusion. We are asking you to fund "Privacy Legion" because you also want to provide individuals with a safe and secure means to text others securely regardless of the platform.
We are asking for your support and your trust.  We have the highest ethics, morals, and values.  We would never sacrifice your information privacy to make a buck.  We would greatly appreciate any assistance that you might lend in making "Privacy Legion" a reality. You can learn more about CDSS at www.cdss-llc.com.

THE PITCH
THE STORY
THE BRANDING
The name you see throughout the campaign, (NowU, pro-nounced NowYOU), is something I came up with, is not the final brand name.  I am not a branding genius so I just came up with something.  That we can work on.  
The main concept I'd like you to take away from the campaign is the "how the product works", and the simplistic-ness, (if you will).  This could be a life-saving product for fast emergency dialing. It can be used to open a smartphone app or make a simple solution to stop distractive phones while driving.  Please read more and comments are welcome. Thank you.
AROUND THE WEB
This video is a proof of concept by a security expert at a university that I found on youtube.

There are 1.5 billion smartphones out there. 
These are issues we face when creating new technologies.  
This is one focus BUT, it is not the only reason for this product.
In the future this product can be used to open an app, (PHYSICALLY), allowing more ease for people who want a easier way of using their smartphone and in general who might not be as knowledgable on technology.

WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?
  I will use the money to purchase more inventory, and new equipment for in-house inventory.  That means I will make units on-site and I can ship directly to you, the customer.  
Shapeways will still be a manufacturer of the product.

You can purchase and put together your own case right now at my shop in the link below
Shapeways.com/shops/artifex3d
The business focus is to provide a central solution to....
A) Stop texting while driving and phone use in general by a driver. 
B) Help the less technical savvy to use their smartphone with more ease and control with better interoperability. A lower degree of difficulty in navigation.
IMPROVEMENTS
In the future, the Smartphone disrupter will become part of the bluetooth pairing process for the smartphone allowing for better access to apps and functions creating a lower degree of difficulty navigating through app settings.
Electronic privacy breaches are too common. And unfortunatey we're all at risk! Examples include hacked email and banking accounts, and stolen nude photos from cloud storage services. Little is known about the emotional/stress consequences to people of such breaches. I'm conducting this project to learn more information about emotional reactions to privacy breaches in order to minimize those reactions in the future.
I'm Dr. Jon Elhai, a psychologist and professor at the University of Toledo in Ohio. In this project, I plan to conduct a scientific study on the emotional and stress effects of such privacy breaches. Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Mturk) internet platform will be used to recruit several hundred participants who will be asked about stress experienced from possible previous and potential future account hacking. 
Project funds from backers will be used to conduct the research study, including supporting the Amazon Mturk platform for recruitment, web survey development software fees, and publishing the results in a reputable scientific journal (funding goal = $500). Funding past the goal will be used to recruit more subjects in this line of scientific research.
In my scientific career, I have published more than 150 studies (including numerous web surveys) of stress and anxiety in scientific journals. However, studying stress from electronic breaches is a brand-new area that has not been studied before. And this kind of information can help people who have experienced these breaches.
Rewards for backing this project include information that I will provide to help backers better protect themselves online (including informational materials, email and videoconferencing consultation).
Here is an estimated Project Timeline:
November 2014: Obtain Research Ethics Approval at the University of Toledo; Build Web Survey.
December 2014: Launch survey on Amazon Mturk. Begin consultation for backers who request it.
January 2015: Analyze data and write results. Continue consultation with backers.
February 2015: Report results to backers. Submit results to a scientific journal.
March 2015: Complete consultation with backers.

Cannabis Rocks! Game Cards
This mobile app will help increase LAUGHTER And ANXIETY RELIEF, while enabling immediate Access and Portability in time of need: play anywhere, play with others near or far,  and have access to the directory and forum.  Retain your privacy and play with others you desire to play with.
see How the game is played below by clicking link
http://youtu.be/4Ilgwu7nk4U
click link above to see game play
Cannabis Rocks! current model: 10 Hits and 10 No Hits
Play is determined by flipping coin or stone and spinning the stone.  Depending on the finger landed on, that is the play.  The play can go in any direction, at any time and can be Hit or No Hit.
How is Cannabis Rocks! Game Played
Cannabis Rocks Game Plays to the right, until it doesn't. This Game goes in any direction, at anytime, and anyone can win with the right combination!  This Game is meant for Laughter and fun, with hilarious moves and Plays.  For instance, if you land on Bogart, you first bogart, which then also triggers a "Spin Off' with all other players.  The first player to spin the "shot gun" move wins the play. The Player first plays Shot Gun with the player of choice, then continues on for a chance to win the game.  If unsuccessful in the next sequence of plays, the game passes to Shot Guns immediate right and play continues.
The game is a wild ride of fun.  Each Hit or No Hit action has a sequence, action or inaction which gets hilarious.  You never know which player plays next or what their play will be.
GAME FORUM AND SUPPORT
I have dedicated Cannabisrocksgame.com as a domain which is set up for players to communicate with each other, create connections, answer questions and seek like minded players for remote play.
STRETCH GOAL
Our ultimate stretch goal is to create a deeply diversified mobile game app so You have the ultimate game experience whether by Yourself or with others. The amount of $5,000 is the least amount to begin this creation, utilizing the most talented developers.
Our stretch goal is to receive the adequate funding enabling us to afford the finest of game developers possible to accomplish this. We have a list of creative developers that understand our goal.  The final developer is based on our final budget.  We would love to have the leaf come out and shake it's booty when you win the game, but only if we can  a f f o r d  it! 
THE TOP 10 BACKERS RECEIVE HONORS OF NAMING 1 PLAYER POSITION EACH FOR PRE-SELECTED USERNAMES
The 10 pre-named player positions will be created by the top 10 backers. Each will have the honor to create  a username for all gamers to pre select.
10 additional positions will be integrated to enable players to create their own username.  Everyone wins at this game!
CANNABIS ROCKS GAME HISTORY AND TRANSFORMATION
Cannabis Rocks Game first began as a therapeutic version of a product called Medical Minis.  Medical Minis are black, highly polished, 1 inch stones, first etched (sandblasted) and then airbrushed with colors associated with emotions, like color therapy. Medical Minis are used in therapy for Medical Dispensary patients to work through emotions by selecting the stone associated with the emotion experiencing at the time. 
Original Cannabis Rocks! Game
Cannabis Rocks Games' first version began as 10 Medical Minis stones, etched on both sides and then airbrushed with colors associated with the  game action.  First, the player would pick one stone out from the bag and coordinate the action or in- action with the stone.  Hit or No Hit play move.
Current Cannabis Rocks! Game model
Cannabis Rocks Candy stones are the current game model, which consists of  one 3 inch black, highly polished oval stone which is spun in a circular motion with a 9 fingered leaf and stem.  Each finger of a leaf/stem equalling a Hit or No Hit Move and 1 double sided/ leafed Medical Mini for the flipping game piece or our NEW Cannabis Coins which are the best.  One side of the Medical Mini has a green leaf etched and airbrushed into the stone and the opposite side is a red leaf. Green is  for a Hit  Play and Red for a No Hit Play for a total of 20 Hit/No Hit Plays total.
Cannabis Rocks! Game on Game/Stash Carry
Cannabis Coins were created to use in place of Medical Minis, if desired.
CANNABIS COIN CURRENCY
Cannabis Coins also became a 420 coin and currency for others to utilize at their discretion for trading cannabis,  gifting and messages to other users.  The coins are not only stunning, they each have their own character and make beautiful necklaces and charms.  This was truly a learning curve in my artistic skills from carving wax to cooking  metal!
These make the best game flipping coins and are available in Copper, Bronze, Silver and 24 k Gold using precious metal clay.
Beasties are the Table top version with a miniature lazy susan shown below in the rewards section.  Game stash bags complete the game and come in genuine leather, cow Hide, recycled leather and soon to be released Hemp!
Cannabis Coins transformed the game from a double sided red  and green stone to a flipping coin with choice of indented and protruding leaves.
Coins and Medical Minis
Cannabis Coins by Cannabis Rocks are created from using Precious 
Cannabis Rocks! Game Mobile Game App will enable different levels of play for the more serious tolerance level or take it down a notch for Medical patients to enjoy their own level.
SO WHY DO WE NEED A MOBILE GAME APP?
With mobility enabled, players can play with selected players either together in the same place or from afar.  Just as video gamers meet and play games with remote play features,  this game enables the same ability with privacy benefits, game specifications to meet their playing goals (tolerancy)  and a player does not need the original game version in hand to play.  They can virtually create their game within the existing game format.
This also enable players to play at home with others from afar and not have the legal implications.
HOW WILL THE MOBILE APP WORK?
The current game will be retain the original game rules, however the plays and moves are to be completely customized by each player.  Once customized, eah player can log into their game and play that game version.  The original game version is always connected to the new version if players want to play the original, at any time.
First off, Each player will select their playing name from a list of pre-created players or create their own unique user name.
Next, The first move is to 'flip the virtual coin" and spin the virtual leaf until the first player flips green and spins Shot Gun, which is how my original game begins.
The sequence continues until one player wins as the first player and plays that play. Play continue to the right of the first player, until it takes a turn in any direction, to any player. 
The rules of the game are the same, however, with this app, it will give you the option to customize your own Hit/No Hit rules to customize your game experience to your preferred level of play! 
So with a simple rule override option, users can have a custom created game with their own moves to satisfy the player level. We're not growing pot like other apps do, you are playing Cannabis Rocks with your own game additions in addition to any game rules on the Original Version you like or play the Original which is easy and hilarious.
You become the game designer in a way and play your level.
We are offering our products only via Kickstarter until this fundraiser is over.  So pick your favorite level and combination of rewards and You get the game as the ultimate reward!  
Virtual high Fives to all Backers and Supporters.  This Game Will Rock!

This project is in response to the wholesale loss of our privacy, courtesy of governments and otherwise.  Centralization of data has made it all too easy for others to surreptitiously profit from your personal information.  I say let's do something to take back some of our privacy.
On that note, I have cobbled together some of my skills and knowledge, done some research, and am now developing the "Proof Of Concept". The current design is actually yet another in a string of re-engineered ideas spanning many years. It seems like I might have something this time.
MyDarkWeb is a communications infrastructure -- applications of various sorts can be built on it.  I have a design that uses cryptography to enable private communications between people.  I also believe that I can enable a level of anonymity for a subset of communications.
This project is (largely) not a business idea - I want to get it done and unleash it for free.  I am in the middle of developing it.  If it takes off in the open-source world, it could grow into something.
Initial applications in the proof-of-concept are:
simple messaging (akin to email)
simple forum (text/photo posts with comments)
Design Points (warning: technical jargon):
OpenSource for transparency
Standard cryptographic primitives
Multiple "identity" handling -- published and private identities
A directory (Public-Key Server) so people can connect with you
A local application server, which runs on your PC
Local, static, code base (new code isn't downloaded every time you use it)
Anonymous communication interchange (inspired by old-school usenet, if you are familiar)
Private/Encrypted "cloud" storage of your data, for data backup, and maybe multi-site capabilities
Local encryption-key handling
A good (new?) idea of how public-key verification is going to work
Funding Pays For:
Development time of the proof-of-concept
Hosting of the central anonymous interchange and the private cloud storage
Review of code by a professional cryptographer (I hope)
What is it?
Cloudaki is a privacy-oriented, distributed, end-to-end encrypted social network.
The network is based on plug-n-play, credit-sized computers, like Raspberry PI.
Joining is as simple as 1,2,3
Plug your Cloudaki box on a free-port on your home router.
Download the open-source Cloudaki app on your mobile device or computer.
Find your friends and start enjoying.
What are the key characteristics?
Privacy. End-to-end encryption, using public key cryptography algorithms, means no ads, no data collection, no analytics.
Freedom. Decentralized means you are free to choose your online presence anyway you want it. You are free to share anything you want with whoever you want.
Independence. Owning your Cloudaki box means you own all your data. Also the open source nature of Cloudaki means you are not tied in to a specific vendor or network.
Plug-n-play. Cloudaki boxes are UPnP compatible and don't required a static address. This means you can just plug your Cloudaki box to your router and you are ready to go.
Extensibility. Cloudaki boxes come with a framework that allow you to develop or download applications that can extend your online presence anyway you can imagine.
Licencing
Cloudaki Application will be open-source.
For the Cloudaki Box we are investigating for some kind of dual-license:
Free for individuals to download the source and binaries, modify them and install them on as many machines as they like. 
A very reasonable license fee for any company that wants to host their own farm of Virtual Cloudaki-boxes or built their own Cloudaki-compatible boxes.
What is the current state?
PLAY

We have a prototype version of the Cloudaki box based on an Odroid computer and a very early version of the Cloudaki application on Android. At the moment we are able to send invites, add contacts, exchange secure messages and post photos. The application code is written as a library so it can be ported fast and easily on other platforms.
Cloudaki prototype is based on an Odroid U3 computer
How did the whole thing start?
We were always worried about the privacy invasion by the current players in social networking, like being forced to use real names, photos and content being censored, rights of the photos being transferred, etc.
We were also disappointed from the lack of easy-to-use alternatives. For example, although our principles, ideas and some targets align in many ways with Diaspora, we didn't want our users to have to use a Pod maintained by a third-party or having to setting up and maintain their own Pod (it seemed to much of a hard job for the average user. Also the requirement for a valid SSL certificate meant an extra yearly expense).
We wanted something that is plug-and-play, that's why we went to the white board and spent days trying to design a protocol that would enable us to create a product that would "just work" straight out of the box.
After having a draft protocol we spent every weekend coding, testing and adjusting the code for the Cloudaki box and the Cloudaki app. We feel that now is the time to go full time on it, that's why we decided to put it up on kickstarter.
Who is behind Cloudaki?
We are four software engineers, passionate about code and technology, with a dream to change the social networking and communication status quo. We believe that communication should be private, the data should be owned by the user and the user should not be tied in to a single company or platform.
We take the "don't be evil" motto one step further; we believe a company should not be evil because it is not in a position to become evil, and not by choice.
What is your business model?
We are planning to create two entities.
One will be a not-for-profit organization that will define, expand, control and license the Cloudaki protocol to vendors who want to build their own Clouadki compatible, virtual or hardware, boxes.
The second will be the Cloudaki company that will produce the Cloudaki boxes and provide a series of adjacency services. 
Why is the pledge so high?
We want the project to succeed and to do so we want to be sure we have enough funds to create high quality software and hardware. We plan to hire the best designers, hardware and software engineers to work on the Cloudaki box and the application for the five main operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android).
Production and Fulfillment Plan
The main parts of Cloudaki are:
Cloudaki Protocol
Cloudaki Box Hardware
Cloudaki Box Softare
Cloudaki Application Software
Cloudaki Protocol
The first draft of Cloudaki protocol is already defined and documented and was used to produce the demo. Small adjustments and additions are expected to continue until 9/2015 at which point the protocol will be frozen until the first release.
Cloudaki Box Hardware
The Cloudaki box hardware at the moment is based on off-the-self credit-card sized computers like Raspberry Pi and Odroid. We do not expect to start planning for a tailor built hardware until 3/2015.
The bare minimal requirement for the project will be shipping off-the-self credit-card sized computers with all the Cloudaki Box software pre-installed.
The final vision is custom hardware with exceptional design and finish.
Cloudaki Box Software
The software needed to serve clients is already implementing more than 80% of the Cloudaki protocol. We expect it to be the first one completed and production ready by 6/2015. The management daemon is still in design phase. We expect to start implementation by 7/2015 and finish by 10/2015.
The bare minimal requirement is the Cloudaki server daemon.
The final vision is a lean-and-mean version of linux OS with a complete suite of applications to enable serving the Cloudaki clients, provide the option of remote monitoring and management of the box and provide a full stack SDK allowing users and developers to write add-ons.
Cloudaki Application Software
The software implementing the Cloudaki protocol is being implemented as a shared library able to run on Android, Linux, OS X, iOS and Windows. The library is already implementing 80% of the Cloudaki protocol.
Android front-end is in a very early prototype state and expect to have it complete by 4/2015. The implementation of the rest of the front-ends will start simultaneously on 4/2015 with completion date 11/2015.
The bare minimal requirement is an iOS and an Android application that will enable user to exchange secure messages, to make posts of photos, videos, text and url links, and enable comments.
The final vision is full functionality of the Cloudaki protocols to be supported in all major operating systems (Linux, OSX, Windows, Android and iOS).
How do our supporters know we are on track ?
We will be hosting Cloudaki meeting every 2 months to give an update to our supporters
Live Q&A sessions will be organized to answer all the questions and concerns
Emails will be sent after every milestones
First live Cloudaki meeting to be held on February the 14th
SHIELDS Life: Empowering Consumer Health and Protection
Each one of us are unique as individuals.  Most of us have good intentions.  Many of us are strong in faith, value right from wrong, are ethical in behavior, and genuine by nature. I cannot speak for the next person but I know I am one of these individuals.  In a world where there is uncertainty and frustration, political drivers and deceit over honor and values, the rise of global terrorism, infectious and emergent diseases, etc., we as individuals and as a nation are exposed and vulnerable.
SHIELDS Life Programs are dedicated to our member community. We take care of each other. We engage and empower our community. We protect our family. We look to build core values in our children, educate them, and create vehicles for health and prosperity for their future.
As "Stewards of Consumer Health and Protection‰Û, our objective is to set the foundation for improving participants life outcomes through consumer benefits, services, incentives, savings, and vast opportunities to the SHIELDS member community.  
SHIELDS (‰ÛÏSafeguarded Health Information Exchange & Life Decision Support‰Û) Project brings two foundational components incorporated as part of the SHIELDS solution and platform, the members services, and community benefits by:
Facilitating opportunities and the support mechanisms focused on protecting our families and improving our member community life outcomes and circumstances
Empowering members through communication, awareness, and control
Addressing consumers challenges and frustrations with healthcare, insurance, claims, costs, financial hardships, and Healthcare reform
Offer circumstantial custom health insurance benefits, better-quality health
Lowering health care and insurance costs
Providing a means for wealth and prosperity as vested participants in SHIELDS Life program
The outcome of this project will result in the development, implementation, and launch of a consumer application, services, and member web portal, enabling consumer controls, communication and awareness to personal health information and records. The solution services provide aggregation, anonymization, and compliance controls service engine of personal health information and records. 
The solution platform, applications, services, and programs set the basis for our next generations to come by:
Protecting personal health information and records from misuse / theft
Aggregating Personal Health Information and Records  
Overview
To benefit your understanding and introduction to our project (‰ÛÏSHIELDS‰Û), we start with some facts from a recent study by Ponemon Institute as well as a couple questions to ask yourself prior to reading on. Your responses and any feedback will be much appreciated.  All information will remain private and confidential.
YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION
78% of individuals in the study say it is important to have access and more control of their health records.  Of those respondents 56% do not check their medical records accuracy and 51% do not know how to check their Personal Health Records. We ask:
Personal Health Records Awareness
MEDICAL INFORMATION THEFT AND FRAUD
Information theft and fraud is an increasingly growing risk for individuals and continues to be a significant costly economic impact.  Medical identity theft in the US for 2013, estimated that 1.84 million adult-aged Americans or close family members were victims, a 19% increase from the 1.52 million individuals from 2012.  36% of the victims incurred an average cost of $18,660 to restore their medical identity as a result of the crimes for a total out-of-pocket costs upwards of $12.3 billion.We ask:
Health Information Theft & Fraud
Background
Today‰Ûªs world leaves us susceptible. We get lost in the shuffle of political bouts. Our voices and needs are pooled into demographic groupings. Lives are altered by mandates, rising costs, and lack of opportunity to meet personal circumstances. Feelings of distrust and weariness in our incumbents.Some have the means to adapt, yet many don‰Ûªt.
Medical information, insurance fraud and out-of-pocket mitigation costs continue to rise affecting consumers who fall victim, impacting their individual circumstance with emotional and financial pressures, uncertainty and frustration, in an already complex healthcare situation to any average individual.  The 40 million existing uninsured individuals combined with a market shift of consumer roll-over due to ACA reforms position, mandates, and the increasing demand placed on consumer‰Ûªs as ‰ÛÏactive participants in health‰Û produce a substantial market opportunity.
SHIELDS Life Programs integrated platform, services, and consumer products well represent and are highly significant to this US population as part of improving consumer health and circumstance through incentives, while deciphering and adapting a complex national health system and building a trusted Consumer brand. 
Just like any relationship, we grow through trust, support, and by caring for one another. However, relationships are always not easy and takes commitment and reasoning from all parties. SHIELDS is committed to improving consumers‰Ûª life circumstances and building upon individuality by facilitating the necessary relationships with like-minded businesses focused on making a difference in your life.
In tomorrow‰Ûªs world, SHIELDS Life Program brings a new way to live. A new chapter, empowering us with the means and tools to make a difference in our individual lives, our family, and or someone less fortunate. Enabling and encouraging consumers to trust again, change behavior, and take a vested interest in their health and wellbeing, as we take a vested interest in your health and wellbeing.
Why We Are Here
As the business moves forwards through the process of securing capital investment for the larger scale holistic solution and establishing financial stability to enter the necessary partner agreements to meet our goals, we are extending our firms vehicles to raise the capital to spearhead the foundational components of the SHIELDS platform and Phase 1 application development.
To initiate our efforts we require a minimum of $1,600,000 investment and working capital through the end of the year, knowing additional funding will be required extending the pilot out to our target markets as we progress to production and the commercial offering of the SHIELDS services and Programs. This funding provides the necessary working capital for project resources, legal, vendor services, implementation, environment readiness (dev, test, and staging), business development, marketing, and launch of for SHIELDS Pilot Phase.
Our future state roadmap extends SHIELDS commitment to its members through the creation and investment of the ‰ÛÏConsumer Growth Fund‰Û facilitating our members to be ‰ÛÏvested in their health‰Û, as SHIELDS is ‰ÛÏvested in our members health, prosperity, and protection‰Û by matching a predetermined percentage of members vested interests.
Project Scope
CHANGE THE FACE OF HEALTHCARE
Who is accountable for your private information? The SHIELDS solution, unlike our competitors, will empower consumers by directly enabling members access to their Personal Health Information offering privacy protection, compliance, and guarded representation. 
Our competitors‰Ûª offer or facilitate numerous healthcare products and solutions, but their customer base are those who (currently) own or control your health information scattered across an array of systems, networks, and data stores.  Many of our competitors are well equipped and well versed at passing the buck when it comes to safeguarding your information and being held accountable beyond their internal systems and networks.  With SHIELDS, consumers no longer remain in the dark but instead take control of their own PHR and information. 
Consumer Applications & Controls
SHIELDS consumer application enables privacy protection of their personal and health information, and the services component collects, secures, anonymizes, audits, and monitors the information sought after by so many. 
Whether healthcare providers or insurers looking to improve care and reduce costs, or government initiatives and mandates to share information and exchange data, or hackers scraping and stealing personal and health information to use to their benefit, SHIELDS prevents illicit use and access unless authorized by you, the rightful owner of your personal and private information. The solution injects compliance rules into the security architecture, process workflows, and query validation services coupled with incursion detection engine facilitates accountability of those who ‰ÛÏown‰Û or ‰ÛÏhouse‰Û your PHR and information.
Technology Platform & Solution
With value to both consumers and our clients (insurance providers) or otherwise partners, consumers get their information collected, structured, privatized, and locked down in a centralized private data store at no cost to the them while reducing risk of fraud and misuse for our insurance partners.  Insurers cover the costs for their enrolled consumers with the benefit of improving privacy and compliance of enrollees‰Ûª health information and mitigating risks associated to fraud and privacy protection (audited and authorized). 
SHIELDS participating consumers and organizations will be offered effective, cost transparent, comprehensible consumer health plans, enrollment, and access to SHIELDS supplement benefits and services beyond healthcare and the insurance industries. Insurers re-purpose anonymized PHR information for analytical use toward their goals to help lower premiums for consumers, improve cost transparency, and validate claims is made available to them.  Shields Technology Roadmap incorporates:
SHIELDS (‰ÛÏSafeguarded Health Information Exchange & Life Decision Support‰Û)
Consumer privacy protection of personal and health information
Aggregation services component collects, secures, anonymizes, audits, and monitors the information
SHIELDS Life Programs
SHIELDS reference architecture and design is comprised of industry leading technology, software, hardware, compliance and security components, built on a Service-oriented Architecture (‰ÛÏSOA‰Û), integrated and interoperable as a robust and scalable solution with supplement value-add services and applications such as consumer health benefits and enrollment, incentive programs, web and mobile based privacy protection application, and health information compliance, collectively providing:
Privacy Protection of individuals‰Ûª personal health records (PHR)
PHR aggregation
Individual anonymity
Management controls
Compliance & Fraud Mitigation
Additionally, the private secure consumer portal facilitates consumer communication, engagement, and awareness (‰ÛÏCE&A‰Û) coupled with the compliance engine, audit tracking, and access controls of their personal health records. 
High-Level Requirements
In similar fashion to LifeLockå¨ service protection for consumer‰Ûªs identity, the SHIELDS Consumer application portal facilitates consumer control and privacy protection in preserving their personal health and medical information by securely privatizing and protecting medical records at the individual level.  The Pilot Phase of the SHIELDS project will focus on the consumer application and foundational components include the following:
Reference Architecture and Solution Design
Multi-layer security authentication and anonymizing (or de-identifying) Private Information (‰ÛÏPI‰Û)
Stringent security infrastructure and information framework and Standard Operating Procedures (‰ÛÏSOP‰Û)
Elaborate Data Security Model, Management, Mapping, and Translation
Intrusion Detection, Access Audits, History Archive, Authorized Access Lists
Extend aggregation and compliance tools to incorporate PHR Privacy & Protection validation and conformity and Knowledgebase
Platform and Services
SOA Framework solutioned for reuse, configurability, and scalability with the option to customize to customers specific requirements

Thank you for visiting the YeeFox page at kickstarter. I know that there are lot‰Ûªs of loving people like you around the world, who are willing to see and fund projects like this.

What is it? YeeFox is not out to compete with any browser maker, but if you believe in surfing the web, moving from website to website, without been tagged and tracked like animals in the wild, that scientists perform studies on, then join me to fulfill this goal, in helping to pursue this dream. I am a talented IT guys in software and web development setout to raise money to build YeeFox; a web browser using open source software that will automatically allow or put the user/surfer in control of their online privacy while surfing the web, as they surf from website to website without been tracked by every visited website. Visiting a website should not be an open license with exclusive rights to the visited website to track the surfer to every website he/she visit after living their site, and in some cases to the web pages the user visit for up to ninety days. By pledging at least twenty dollars, you will be essentially pre-ordering a CD copy with the first edition of YeeFox as a collectable.
What type of project is that?
Web privacy and connectedness are twins that must never be separated from each another. Yeefox helps make the web surfer uphold his/her exclusive rights to their online privacy when leaving a website; by taking away the centralized web surfing privacy (spying for free), from corporate networks and putting it back in the hands of the user/surfer. Don‰Ûªt get it wrong; the site you are on will still know that you are there.

What is going to be build?
This is how it goes down: Corporate networks have long been centralized with web users web surfing privacy (spying for free). YeeFox web browser work opposite to that effect, by securing the web surfer privacy on websites visited, and future website visit. The technology is available and I already figured it out as an alternative to the solution. YeeFox is building from the ground up.
Why money is needed for this project?
To accomplish this task requires setup cost, for covering servers, firewall hardware and software ect., a place to house the equipment and other cost associated with hosting a network. Yeefox will be build as describe, and will be implemented with another idea, by integrate YeeFox with a social networking website that is much friendlier and easier for both young and older forks to use, allowing the older users to navigate easier and faster. Support the YeeFox project with your donation, so that the YeeFox project can come alive. The goal is to re-structure the core of the browser, add features that will be a paid version, and to secure social networking users from the venerability of security risks pose by personalized phishing attack as describe by John Timmer on February 24, 2010.
I am raising $12,000 in a timely manner to help cover the cost associated with the YeeFox project, that would also help change the future of social networking.
Promise to all donors:
YeeFox will be launch some time in early fall 2011 as a standalone encrypted web browser with some new browser security features. And it‰Ûªs integrated Social networking website.

Passwords must be changed.
With the exponential growth of the internet, we rely on important online services more every day. These services are protected by passwords, however, and passwords are a problem. It has become almost impossible to create passwords that are memorable, quick to enter, and secure.
Our world is changing. Passwords must change, too.  
We set out to change passwords, and we created Crypta.
Introducing
Crypta is a fingerprint-protected USB device that allows you to log into any account on any computer with just your fingerprint.
All you have to do is plug Crypta into a computer, select the account you want to log in to, and scan your finger. Youâ€™re instantly and automatically logged in.
Weâ€™re in the news!
PLAY

Video link here
Why You Need a Crypta
A hacker can crack the average password in under 3 minutesÂ¹
432 Million accounts were hacked in 2013, aloneÂ²
That is an account hacked every 73 milliseconds
The average user has more than 30 accounts to manage
We constantly forget passwords
How it Works
Crypta works by emulating a USB keyboard; it types in the correct username and password when it detects your fingerprint.
By storing your usernames and passwords and inputting them for you, Crypta allows you to use incredibly secure, randomized passwords without the hassle of remembering them.
Crypta is compatible with most computers, tablets, and phones. It works on any site or application that requires a username and/or password. Crypta works without any additional drivers or software.
Since it types in your usernames and passwords for you, logging in takes literally seconds.
Most importantly, Crypta is incredibly secure, utilizing fingerprint recognition, encryption, and lengthy, randomized passwords to make sure all of your accounts are safe. Crypta only logs you in if it knows itâ€™s you.
In essence, Crypta acts as universal, fingerprint-protected autofill anywhere you go.
 Use it anywhere!
 Crypta only needs to be set up once. Using our open-source and offline administrative software, you can configure all of the data on your Crypta.
After setup, it will work on any computer system.
Crypta works on smartphones, laptops, desktops, tablets, and more.
In addition, Crypta is not limited to online accounts. It works with anything that needs a password to log in.
Ultra-Portable
Carry it anywhere you go. Your fingers are now keys to your virtual world.
 How To Use Crypta
 Crypta does not use complicated software to input your credentials. We use a simple, yet secure, method that works wherever keyboards work. Crypta is designed to solve problems, not create hassles.
Using Crypta is super simple. Logging into an account has never been easier.
1. Go to the website/account you want to log into.
2. Plug in Crypta and select the website.
3. Scan your finger. Youâ€™re logged in!
Why is it so simple?
Crypta remembers your credentials and types in your username and password for you. You won't even have to lift a finger - except the one you scan.
 Is it secure?
 We went the extra mile for security!
We value transparency and security. Our management app and firmware for Crypta will be open source.
All software is run locally.
Crypta does not communicate with any computer other than your linked computer.
Only your linked management app (secured by certificates) can access/configure Crypta.
All of our software uses military-grade encryption to secure data. 
All raw data on Crypta is encrypted. This data is only accessible when Crypta detects your finger.
You may use one or more fingers to secure your accounts.
In addition, we give the option of using a long string of randomized characters as your password. This will ensure your accounts are extra safe.
Since you don't need to memorize or type the complicated passwords anymore, a scan of a finger is all you need for ultimate security.
 Specs
Why is Crypta better than other password managers?
Crypta is universal on all modern (and some not!) systems without the need to install drivers/apps.
Secured local storage; nothing is transmitted through the air.
Your data will be encrypted from the moment you configure your Crypta. You are in complete control of your passwords.
Crypta is military-grade encrypted.
Crypta inputs the username and password for you: no reading off of tiny screens or typing required.
Simplicity and transparency are our goals. Crypta does what you want it to do, putting only you in control.
You will never have to remember (or forget!) another password again.
Software-based password managers can get hackedÂ³. Crypta, however, is a hardware-based, fingerprint-protected password manager with the same ease of use as any autofill.
Campaign Stretch Goals
Our Story
Crypta began in the summer of 2013 when Dylan became frustrated with passwords. He wanted to make sure his online Bitcoin wallet was secure, but realized that he was using the same three passwords for all of his accounts. If someone acquired his Facebook password, theyâ€™d be able to access his online Bitcoin account as well, putting his investment at risk.
He knew he had to use more secure, randomized, and unique passwords, but had no good way to record them. He couldnâ€™t possibly remember them, a notebook would have him laboriously typing in passwords, and an Excel document full of credentials would be a confusing hassle. Dylan knew that a good solution did not yet exist, so he created his own and called it â€œImprint.â€ After showing Imprint to others in his school, Staten Island Tech, he realized that he wasnâ€™t the only one frustrated with passwords.
Through the Young Entrepreneurâ€™s Academy, a program that teaches high schoolers how to start a business, Dylan met his co-founder, Jimmy. They quickly discovered how well they work together and decided to team up to make Imprint a reality. After calling their new company â€œWave,â€ they created a team consisting of other students from their school. After many changes and revisions, lots of hard work, and many hours spent networking, learning, and researching, â€œImprintâ€ and â€œWaveâ€ became what we are today: Crypta.
Our Philosophy
Our philosophy, like using Crypta, is simple. We want to make online security easy, but still give our users complete control of their data. By open-sourcing our software and only storing data locally, weâ€™re making sure that our users alone decide what happens to their data.
Our goal for our Kickstarter campaign is to make our backers happy and solve their password problems. We aim to surpass expectations of Crypta and deliver a product that truly revolutionizes passwords the way we say it will. As individuals, weâ€™ve backed Kickstarter campaigns in the past, and we understand how important transparency and frequent updates are to a successful end result. We will be completely transparent with our backers and stay true to our promises.

Whatâ€™s tuit?
Tuit offers a complete solution to secure Android-based mobile devices (provisional patent application US 61/830,866). Itâ€™s a ring which you wear on your hand that communicates with your mobile device using our Tuit mobile app to uniquely identify you and causes it to unlock immediately (the opening door animation is just for show in the video and can be disabled), in a seamless and smooth operation. Plus, it has a nice ring tuit :)
This video shows how quickly you can start using your device with Tuit:
Why tuit?
Mobile devices in use today, particularly smartphones and tablets, hold a great deal of our private and sensitive information. These devices are used to access e-mails, connect to social networks and even manage bank accounts. Losing your phone could seriously compromise your privacy and can even lead to identity theft. Even when someone you know handles your device, it can lead to awkward and unwanted situations.
We feel the current solutions for securing mobile devices, by using PIN codes, password and patterns, are cumbersome and inhibiting. Your device should be locked - but not when YOU want to use it.
Thereâ€™s magic tuit 
Tuit gives you the magic touch. By using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, Tuit communicates with our Lockscreen Mobile App each time you turn on your screen to use your device. Anyone who picks up your phone or tablet just sees a standard lockscreen asking to enter a PIN code or draw a pattern. But, when you wear your Tuit on your hand and use that hand to hold your device, itâ€™s always open and ready for use. Cool, right?
Here's a short proof-of-concept video we made early on, when we got the first prototype:
Tuit Lockscreen App
Once you get Tuit, you will need to install the the Tuit Lockscreen companion app. To start using Tuit, you have to first pair your ring to your device. This is a short process, in which you simply place your Tuit near the back of your device, hold it there for a few seconds and wait for the confirmation. That's it. You are now ready to start using Tuit. It's that easy.
Unique and Secure
Our Lockscreen app verifies the authenticity of your Tuit by using a cryptographic digital signature. Each Tuit has this unique signature which cannot be copied or impersonated.
And it has a certain style tuit . . . 
Weâ€™ve given a lot of thought to Tuitâ€™s design and look. We see it as more than a gadget - itâ€™s an accessory. It has to have style.
Tuit Prototypes (rev. 7)
Here you can see our prototypes, created using an advanced laser-based prototyping process. With your help we will produce Tuits using high-pressure injection-molding from Polycarbonate. With a refined design, the finished Tuit will look much better - thinner, narrower and smoother.
After a lengthy process, in the end we made the (hard) decision to go with a simplistic but sophisticated, unisex look. We felt it gave us the widest variety of styles that could fit pretty much anyone.
Before choosing the current design, we considered a number of concepts:
We especially liked the design in concept 3, and we'd love to be able to make it in the future. We'd like to hear your thoughts.
Help spread the word
You can also help us by sharing this project on social media.

Rewards
By helping us make Tuit a reality you can be the very first owners who get to use Tuit to enhance their protection. The Tuits we offer here will come in three sizes: Small (US 7.5), Medium (US 8.5) and Large (US 9.5), as shown in this chart:
Ring Sizes Chart
From our understanding these sizes should cover a substantial portion of the population.
In terms of color styles, the basic Tuit style will be Silver on outside and Black on the inside. For the more colorful personalities among you, we also offer the Color Tuits:
Pearl White outside and Light Blue inside
Silver outside and Orange inside
Pink outside and Pearl White inside
We plan to offer more style choices in the future.
The Road Tuit
We started out with just a simple silicone ring, an RFID Chip and an idea...
We began by researching and learning everything there is to know about NFC. We began studying and testing many different types of RFID chips to find the right combination of security level, power requirement, reliability and effective range.
We then teamed up with a design company which specializes in engineering industrial design, and started working with them to come up with a concept to match our vision for the ring, this was the result:
Concept visualization
Sketches of different color styles
At the same time, we set to work on developing our mobile app - learning how NFC works in Android, defining the requirements, and started thinking about the user interface.
After the concept was chosen, a detailed design was drawn up:
Tuit Detailed Design schematics
The Tuit is made up of the 3 ring parts and an RFID chip array. After assembly, the parts are fused together using a technique called Ultrasonic Welding.
Animated Illustration of Tuit's CAD Design
After approving the detailed design, we made the first 3D-printed model:
First rough model of the Tuit
This model was wider then we pictured the Tuit will be. This was mainly because we had used a commodity, standard-sized RFID inlay. We then realized we would need to order a custom sized inlay which would allow us to design a narrower ring.
By then we had a basic working version of our app, and we were extremely excited to use Tuit for the very first time to unlock our phone.
Where we are...
So now, we are at a point where, in order to move forward and make Tuit a viable product that we can produce in large quantities, we require funding.
We will be working with a manufacturer which specializes in this type of injection-molding and has ample experience in this field. One of the important factors for us in choosing this manufacturer was their Quality Assurance and Quality Control department. Once we begin work, we will defined a detailed and thorough procedure to test and verify  each produced item.
Designing and creating the molds is a delicate and lengthy process. It is also quite expensive, and since we want to offer three different sizes of Tuits, we have to multiply everything by 3. On top of that, there are additional costs for the materials, manual assembly and the ultrasonic welding.
Our app, which is responsible for actually securing the mobile device, is coming along nicely, but requires more testing on many devices and platforms, so we can find and fix as many bugs and kinks as possible. We are also going to add more features and improve the interface, with the help of professional mobile UX designers.
Here, in a nutshell, are the steps we took to get here:
We have everything ready, and with your help we can make it happen!

The SEED Project Team is dedicated to protecting our service members and fellow citizens from I.E.D.s â€“ Improvised Explosive Devices, as well as the threat from suicide bombers.
With SEED, Stimulated Emission Enhanced Detection, a known, resonating Terahertz frequency of the explosive material is transmitted. If the explosive is located within the frequency's sweep, the material will absorb some of the applied resonating frequency's energy.
Once this frequency is absorbed and the sweep passes, the explosive material will released the absorbed energy as a unique Secondary Emission. When this secondary emission is detected and analyzed, the type of explosive material can be determined and properly handled.
We need your help to complete this important mission. You can make a difference. Join us today by donating to the SEED Project. Once youâ€™re a part of our team, we will keep you informed of SEEDâ€™s progress through completion.

Creating revolutionary science and technology to secure our world from terrorism
Wouldn't it be great if there were a technology capable of detecting explosives from a safe distance? Sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn't it? Science fiction, even? Well, so did space travel, nuclear power, nano technology and the internet at one point, but theyâ€™re reality now, aren't they?
So, what is this technology?
It's called "SEEDâ€ which stands for â€˜Stimulated Emission Enhanced Detection.â€™  
SEED is a patented, cutting edge technology that uses Terahertz frequencies - otherwise known as 'THz' -  to actively search for specific molecular structures.
While SEED has the theoretical potential to detect a vast array of materials, Team ALVA's SEED focus will be on explosives. 
Why is this?  Simply put, explosives, especially those in the form of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and suicide bombers, are the terroristâ€™s â€˜tool of choice.â€™  They are tools of terror that are not just a scourge for the United States, but a scourge for the international community, civilized society, at large.
More than 6,780 members of the US Armed Forces have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nearly half of them were killed by IEDs, with many others left wounded with traumatic and debilitating injuries.
We can and must do better than that!  World events demand a solution.  
With SEED, there is now the potential for society and those who protect us to have a great 'equalizer' to combat and, possibly even defeat, this terror weapon of choice.
Molecules resonate at specific, unique frequencies based upon material type. Thus, these frequencies serve as spectral 'fingerprints'...with no two molecules having the same frequency. THz frequencies lie between the microwave and infrared (IR) frequencies.
Frequency Spectrum (Hz)
Many material frequencies, especially for explosive compositions, lie within the THz spectrum. In addition, THz waves have low photon energiesâ€”one million times weaker than x-raysâ€”and will not cause harmful photoionization in biological tissues. In standard English, THz frequencies are fundamentally 'bio friendly' ... meaning they're non-hazardous and will not sterilize men, cause dogs to twitch, force birds to crash and burn from the sky or, sad to say, heat your Meals Ready to Eat (MREs). THz, thus, provides a significant advantage for both imaging biological materials and in operational contexts where an operator or other subjects may be exposed to THz radiation. THz can also penetrate or pass through a number of commonly used materials consequently allowing one to identify what's inside or underneath. This characteristic enhances THz's ability to be used in non-invasive and non-destructive inspections.
Imaging
While THz detection technologies are still in their infancy, there are two applications that have been explored to date. The first application is THz imaging, a passive application ... essentially, X-Rays on steroids ... that still requires subjective interpretation of an image.
THz Imaging
Linear Spectroscopy
The second application, also passive, is called 'linear spectroscopy' ... where a known THz frequency is applied to a material and the resulting spectrographic 'output' is analyzed to determine what that material is. In essence, linear spectroscopy is the 'firing' of a 'THz bullet' at an unknown material that can eventually be identified based on the forensic analysis of the fragmented remnants of the THz bullet. The major shortcomings of this approach are: 
(1) the resulting THz 'fragmented remnants' are exceptionally low in energy and impossible to detect from a standoff distance
(2) the THz 'fragmented remnants' must be detected from a location opposite of the applied THz 'bullet' ... tough to do when one does not know where an explosive is located to start with.
THz Linear Spectroscopy
Nonlinear Spectroscopy - SEED  
The third and final application is SEED ... Stimulated Emission Enhanced Detection - a non-passive, interrogative 'nonlinear spectroscopy' application where a known resonating THz frequency of the material in question is applied. If that material, an explosive in this case, is located within the frequency's sweep, the material will absorb some of the applied resonating frequency's energy. This phenomenon is called 'excitation' ... where the addition of a discrete amount of energy called excitation energy to a molecule results in a molecular alteration from its condition of lowest energy ... or ground state ... to one of higher energy ... an excited state.
THz Nonlinear Spectroscopy - SEED
Excitation & Detection
The SEED methodology is a nonlinear THz â€˜cause & effectâ€™ application that searches for a specific material at the molecular level with an â€˜excitationâ€™ harmonic frequency.  Should that material be caught within the excitation sweep, the material will absorb energy from THz excitation.  Once the excitation frequency is removed, the material will be â€˜forced,â€™ by the laws of physics, to return to its â€˜steady stateâ€™ by releasing the absorbed energy in a unique â€˜secondary emissionâ€™ that can be detected.  This secondary emission signal should be able to rise above the background 'white noise' like a flare or, in military jargon, a 'Red Star Cluster.'
In essence, a THz resonating harmonic frequency (2) (an 'external energy' excitation frequency) of the material (1) being searched for is transmitted.
If the material searched for is encountered by the transmitted excitation frequency, molecules of that material will be forced to absorb energy from the transmitted signal (3).
When the resonating THz frequency, or excitation energy, is removed, the molecules are forced to return to their lowest energy level ... or ground state ... and do so by releasing in all directions the absorbed excitation energy in what is called a 'secondary emission' (4) ... a singularly unique spectral 'fingerprint' of relatively high energy that is based on the resonating THz frequency and the material's molecular absorption factors.
SEED Secondary Emission - Identification
It is this secondary emission of explosive compositions that can be subsequently detected and identified from a standoff distance.
Based on sound, fundamental laws of physics, SEED is not just theory, it is achievable.
Furthermore, the SEED nonlinear excitation and secondary emission phenomena has been observed in a lab environment.
Dr. X.-C. Zhang Memo dated Oct. 24, 2010
I can unequivocally state, "that the phenomenology required for success [of SEED] has been observed." I am comfortable in making such a statement for such an event recently occurred in our lab here at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where we observed THz re-emission from a target substance when stimulated with an intense THz pulse excitation. In fact, this observation is very similar to the prediction from ALVA Labs! Our recent observations of this experiment done by two of my students ... are available for your staff's edification upon request.Dr. X.-C. Zhang 
15 Claims Accepted
ALVA Labsâ€™ US Patent for SEED issued 14 August 2012
Primary Claim 14 (Most critical) - A method to detect target materials, comprising the steps of: emitting electromagnetic radiation in the Terahertz range; modulating the electromagnetic radiation to excite molecules in the target materials; and detecting signature emissions of excited molecules in the target materials; wherein the target materials do not require sample preparation, and the steps of emitting, modulating and detecting are performed at a distance of at least 10 meters from the target materials.
NOTE: SEED Patent assignment has been changed from "Graziano" to "ALVA Labs LLC."
Civil Defense & Quality of Life
IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) and Suicide Bombers are the tools of terrorism and a scourge to civilized Society.
During Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, more than 6,780 (updated total) U.S. service member deaths were caused by IEDs, alone.
Link to story: http://apps.washingtonpost.com/national/fallen/causes-of-death/ied/
In January 2015, a 10 year old girl in Nigeria was used as a suicide bomber to kill 20 people in a market while another male suicide bomber in Lebanon killed seven others in a CafÃ©.
Link to story: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/world/africa/suicide-bomber-hits-maiduguri-nigeria-market.html?_r=0 
More recently, concerns have grown and security heightened at U.S. airports following the release on 24 December 2014 by al Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP) - believed to be the group behind the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris on 7 January 2015 - of a magazine issue that featured instructions on how to build what AQAP called a "hidden bomb" from easily purchasable materials, as well as directions on how would-be lone wolves worldwide can evade airport security scanners and sniffer dogs. 
Link to story: http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/14/us/airport-security-aqap/index.html
Furthermore, since 17 January, there has been a spike in online threats made against airlines with over 50 threats being made. While none of the threats have proven credible, such threats do result in costly responses from a multitude of military, law enforcement and airport entities that greatly inconvenience and alarm travelers with jet fighter escorts, aircraft diversions, runway closures and even entire airports being shut down.

And, now, ISIS and Al Qaeda are increasingly mounting and calling for attacks on soft targets as a means of deterring Western assaults on their strongholds -- a strategy that is extending the reach of terrorism to hotels, cafÃ©s, supermarkets and malls where Europeans and Americans once felt safe.

US & Allied Military
Megacity IED Threats
EXTRACT: The U.S. Army has long been leery of cities. Too often, urban warfare has meant heavy casualties, mass destruction and an enormous commitment of time and resources. In cities, enemy forces have more places to hide, and superior U.S. technology becomes less effective.
The world is changing, though, and â€¦ the Army has become convinced that urban combat soon will be unavoidable, and when it happens, it will occur on a scale that the Army has never experienced. The reason? Megacities, or cities with a population of 10 million or more. 
â€œUrban combat is the great leveler,â€ David Shunk, a researcher at the Armyâ€™s Future Warfare Division, wrote in 2014 in Small Wars Journal. â€œStandoff technologies are negated and the city fight is still street to street, floor to floor, and often face to face.â€
Megacities will call for â€œmore ISR, lots of tactical ISR,â€ Goure said, referring to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors, as well as â€œmuch more precision firepower,â€ communications equipment thatâ€™s designed to operate in urban canyons, more effective IED defeat systems and better close-combat weapons.
Link: http://www.armymagazine.org/2015/02/12/megacity-warfare-taking-urban-combat-to-a-whole-new-level/#sthash.C0jPWVQ2.dpbs  
Such concerns, threats and attacks must be stopped!
It is time now to mitigate, if not outright eliminate, these tools of terror and bring a sense of security back to Society.
Contribute to the development of SEED and help us level the 'playing field' in our War on Terror
Stand Off Detection and identification of materials, including explosives, and other related chemicals and materials is one of the most pressing advantages of SEED Technologies.  Imagine explosives being detected at a distance, before they are close enough to cause loss of life.  The approaching car or truck can be scanned from a distance for explosives.  The vest packed with explosives identified from a distance. This changes the terrorist threat.
Now imagine easily going through the airport, without the taking shoes off, emptying your pockets, or the long delays associated with today's security precautions.  This technology has military safety and commercial safety and security applications.  These are just a few.
Explosive compounds â€“ such as Tetryl, RDX & PETN â€“ fall within the THz spectrum and are, thus, susceptible to SEED excitation.
Explosive THz Frequencies
There are several Raman databases or spectral libraries in the open literature. Organic and inorganic explosives including precursors, chemical warfare agents including precursors, pesticides, narcotics, solvents, and naturally occurring toxins are some of the types of compounds tracked by the FBI Hazardous Materials Response Unit. Two libraries have been independently assembled for the FBI Hazardous Materials Response Unit's Raman projects and thus far total more than 450 compounds.
Example of Explosives Catalogue
NOTE: 
While not the focus of our fundraising, it must be noted that SEED has the potential to detect a number of materials other than explosives.   Whether explosive, biological agent, cancer or drug in nature, SEED's molecular detection should theoretically apply to all: 
WMD- Biological Agents Identification: http://www.alva-labs.com/seed-simulated-emission-enhanced-detection/seed-potential/wmd-biological-agents-identification.html
Healthcare Potential of SEED - Cancer & Infectious Diseases: http://www.alva-labs.com/seed-simulated-emission-enhanced-detection/seed-potential/health-care-applications-of-seed.html
Pharmaceutical Contamination Control: http://www.alva-labs.com/seed-simulated-emission-enhanced-detection/seed-potential/pharmaceutical-contamination-control-by-seed.html
So, just what is SEEDâ€™s â€¦ THzâ€™s â€¦ overall potential?
Well, according to DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, THz technologies are cited as one of four DARPA projects that could be â€œbigger than the internet.â€
Link to Story: http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/05/four-darpa-projects-could-be-bigger-internet/84856/
Just how big? SEEDâ€™s potentially a revolutionary technology that can not only detect and identify materials such as explosives at the molecular level from a standoff distance but, also, based on published studies, it may even be able to impact the replication of biological cells, to include toxic contaminants, cancers or WMD biological agents.
Disclaimers - â€˜Bomb Detectorsâ€™
Over the years and especially since September 11, 2001, there have been claims made by many to have manufactured a â€˜long range bomb detector.
Perhaps, the most egregious claim to date was made by Jim McCormick, an English millionaire business man who sold a device called â€˜ADE 651â€™ to twenty countries in the Middle East and Far East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, for as much as $60,000 each. Itâ€™s been reported that the Iraqi government, alone, spent nearly $85 million on the devices.
ADE 651
McCormick claimed that the device could effectively and accurately, from long range, detect the presence and location of various types of explosives, drugs, and other materials. Subsequent investigations proved the ADE 651 device to be little more than a "glorified dowsing rod" with no capability to perform the functions claimed by McCormick. In January 2010, the British government banned the exportation of ADE 651. Later, on 23 April 2013, Jim McCormick, was convicted of three counts of fraud and subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.
See story here: http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/02/world/europe/uk-fake-bomb-detector
Similar claims of â€˜long range bomb detectionâ€™ continue to be made by other unscrupulous manufacturers. These devices include the Global Technical GT200, Alpha 6, Quadro Tracker (aka Positive Molecular Locator), the HEDD1 (formerly known as Sniffex Plus), PSD-22, H3Tec and DKLabs Lifeguard. As noted in a number of published investigations and findings, all have been proven to be useless.
When reviewing such claims, one most carefully examine the science behind it. For now, IF such claims do not involve THz type technology as ALVAâ€™s SEED device does, there is an exceptionally high probability that such a device CANNOT detect any material, much less explosives, from a safe stand off distance.
Over the past few years, crowdfunding has proven to be exceptionally successful for a number of projects large and small, technical and nontechnical.
Team ALVA is exceptionally confident that SEED offers as much, if not more, value to society as any previous successful Kickstarter project.
ALVAâ€™s objective is to raise $1M to achieve the following:
Design and execute a scientific peer reviewed SEED proof of concept (POC) demonstration that will be run in the University of Rochesterâ€™s state of the art THz lab with the consulting support of Dr. XC Zhang.
Begin the catalogue development of a molecular Excitation and Secondary Emission library.
Purchase the Hardware necessary to begin development of a SEED â€˜Beta Deviceâ€™.
It is ALVAâ€™s intent to not only have a successful demonstration of SEEDâ€™s capabilities within a year but also be well on the way towards the development of a commercial SEED device.
While the Hardware components for a Beta Device primarily already exist, the objective for this fundraising campaign (per the ALVA Fundraising Objective) is to:
Scientifically Validate and Demonstrate the SEED concept within a lab environment
Create the necessary THz Excitation & Secondary Emission library catalogue for materials such as explosives, and 
Assemble and Integrate all Hardware and Software components for a viable, out of laboratory SEED Beta Device.
The SEED Device will essentially be composed of FIVE major components:
Computer CPU â€“ in this case, a laptop
A THz frequency transmitter
A THz high power tube (Excitation)
A Secondary Emission Receiver
A THz Excitation & Secondary Emission library catalogue
SEED Explosive Detection Beta Device
Statistically, if the history of adjacent bands of electromagnetic spectrum are any guide, the most compelling and beneficial applications of Terahertz technology are yet to come!
Can SEED really do all weâ€™ve discussed? ALVA certainly believes so and the science and studies to date support that it can. That, as well as one of the worldâ€™s foremost THz experts, says a great deal about SEEDâ€™s potential.
Ultimately, though, even if SEED can do only ONE of the things discussedâ€¦detect explosives or a myriad of other materials to include illicit drugs, detect diseases, WMD bio agents, Ebola or prevent their growth...isnâ€™t it worth a try? Imagine, if successful, SEED will not be just about saving lives or enhancing security, all exceptionally noble pursuits in their own right, it will also lead to immense economic savings with significant national, as well as international, implications.
So, in DARPAâ€™s own words, are you interested and willing to contribute to a project that may eventually prove itself to be the next Internet?
If so, pledge and pass the word. Join this virtuous and honorable effort that will not only create a living testimonial to Captain Josh Byers and all those whoâ€™ve died from the IED and suicide bomber scourge but will also be a part of history. Years from now, we may all be looking back and proudly saying to others, â€œI was a part of SEED.â€
Disclaimer: does not constitute an endorsement by West Point
One of the great sayings at the United States Military Academy is that â€œmuch of the history we teach was made by people we taught.â€
West Point, historically, has been a leader â€¦ whether on the battlefield, Wall Street or in the corporate board room. SEED is not only another chance for USMA to shine but to also lead the way, as it has so many other times before.
Help us prevent the senseless deaths and horrific injuries to service members such as Josh, as well as to fellow citizens world wide, from the threat of undetected explosives on both the battlefield and beyond.

Tramigo Moto speaks several languages which are: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish. Check out the campaign video with subtitles.
Tramigo Moto is a complete motorbike solution consisting of the device wrapped in an integrated casing and software, all purpose-built for riders. Tramigo Moto will connect your ride and trips online and increases the protection of your bike. The integrated casing and wires make it very easy to install, and the available accessories will add an extra layer of security to your bike.
Tramigo Moto is first and foremost designed to be used in a motorcycle and it includes specific motorcycle features and purpose-built casing. However, Tramigo Moto is designed to function also as a multi-purpose device which can be attached to any kind of motorized vehicle which runs with a 12V battery. Besides your motorcycle, you can attach the device to your scooter, ATV, car or even to a snowmobile!
Tramigo Moto is easy to install to any motorcycle thanks to its harness containing the power cables and I/O wires. This harness installation make it equally easy to remove the device from the motorcycle and attach it to another type of vehicle. The harness is attached to the actual device via a socket using a plug which is easy to plug in and plug out. It Is equally easy to remove the device from the Velcro fasteners.  
New reward MULTI RIDER has been added to serve the needs of riders who enjoy riding multiple vehicles. The reward includes up to three (3) sets of harness and Velcros so you can install the harness to all your vehicles making it convenient to switch Tramigo Moto from one vehicle to another. If you happen to own, besides a motorcycle, say an ATV, you can use Tramigo Moto with both of your vehicles. Just plug out the socket and detach the device from the Velcro and install Tramigo Moto to your ATV and you are all set to ride, track and share your ATV with Tramigo Moto. No matter what your ride is, you can track it with Tramigo Moto and share your adventures using Moto Cloud.
For all Kickstarter backers we offer our Moto Cloud free of charge. The Moto Cloud is a real-time software showing you the current status of your motorcycle, alarms and trip information. The Moto Cloud software can be used with any kind of web browser as both mobile and desktop devices are supported. Tramigo Moto and Moto Cloud together will give riders a great user experience and access to a full range of services. Once you have a SIM card with mobile data plan for Tramigo Moto, you are all set to use Moto Cloud!
Tramigo Landmark Data ("TLD") is an exclusively global location database designed and developed for Tramigo tracking devices. Tramigo Moto includes built-in TLD information that generalizes the exact location of the device into a commonly known vicinity and area. Landmarks are chosen so that locally everyone knows them and have an immediate idea of their whereabouts.
TLD landmark concept:
Available in every country in the world;
Multilingual;
Globally harmonized format and standard;
Perfected for instant tracking, both online and offline; and
Cities, towns, villages and information rich POI landmarks.
No more complicated coordinates and slow use of digital maps, but location instantly understood with Moto TLD!
Moto TLD â€“ serves and helps riders
Tramigo shares its landmark experience and know-how with riders and the Kickstarter community. The newly developed Moto TLD includes specific moto landmarks offering plenty of valuable information for riders along popular motorcycle routes, attractions and cities. Initially these moto landmarks will cover North America and Europe and the coverage will be expanded shortly to match countries with meaningful amount of Tramigo Motos in use.
LEAVE A MARK reward gives backers the opportunity to contribute their own landmark(s) which will be included in the Moto TLD from day one! Our Moto Cloud combined with Moto TLD enable the following value-adding features:
Tramigo Moto uses the mobile phone network for data and text message transmission meaning that you need to have a network subscription for Tramigo Moto. The backers need to acquire a SIM card from their own mobile operator and are responsible for the connectivity expenses. We have done our utmost to keep data usage of Tramigo Moto as low as possible and you should be able to use the device for a month with only 10MB of data. We have a vast experience from different mobile operators across the globe, and prior to the reward delivery we will provide all backers our recommendations on which mobile operator to use.
The use of all Tramigo Moto and Moto Cloud features require a SIM card which has both SMS (direct inquiries using mobile phone) and data (use of Moto Cloud) credit. Backers will receive the access to Moto Cloud software for free. The beauty of the text message (SMS) communication is that no critical alert from your bike will go unnoticed due to lack of internet access!
Tramigo Motoâ€™s simple tracking functionalities can be used without a data plan and without Moto Cloud, using any mobile phone SIM-card having text message capability as the device location and status can be checked with a simple text message from your mobile phone. Text messages are very inexpensive in most countries, especially within your own network when you have the same mobile operator for your own mobile phone and Tramigo Moto.
In the future we are planning to open a programming interface (API) for tech savvy to create their own applications to utilize the data created by Tramigo Moto.
Tramigo Moto can be used anywhere in the world where GSM cellular networks exist. So backers from all over the world are most welcome to back our campaign. Countries where we cannot unfortunately offer Tramigo Moto at the moment include South Korea and Japan.
Tramigo Ltd, the manufacturer of Tramigo Moto, had encountered frequent inquiries from the motorcycle community ever since it launched its first portable 'T21' model in 2005. Although not originally designed for motorcycle use and with no special motorcycle features or connectors, these inquiries were motivated by the obvious customer need. We have reason to believe that there are still a few pioneer riders out there with 'T21' installed!
The motorbike product demand increased year-by-year and later in 2008, after the launch of the new 'T22' model, Tramigo developed a do-it-yourself kit and designed a separate rugged casing to this automotive device to provide some motorcycle tailoring. This was a good start, but not enough!
The continuous dialogue with riders encouraged our team founder Markus Vajanne to embark on a full-scale motorcycle product R&D project about a year ago, back in late 2013. Markus put the team together in order to squeeze out all the know-how within the fields of technology, positioning, design and software development and mix that with the landmark concept widely used by Tramigo in automotive tracking in order to create something truly unique, value-adding and custom-made for motorcycle owners. Tramigo Moto combines our teamâ€™s extensive vehicle tracking experience and design expertise and is a high-quality yet affordable motorcycle safety product designed for riders! 
Our experience
With thousands of tracking devices delivered since 2002 to our satisfied customers, Tramigo has acquired unique knowledge in how to deliver a tracking solution that really works. Now this knowledge is put into use to create a new way to do motorcycle tracking. We strongly believe we have created a new benchmark device for all you riders. Each new product development project has its unique challenges but our strong experience in manufacturing, logistics and customer support gives us confidence that we can deliver what we promise. With your backing we will be able to deliver you the ultimate tracking device to keep your ride safe and make riding more fun!
When our team started the development of Tramigo Moto, a decision was made to create a new Moto PCB and design an integrated motorcycle product. A product that has the features and the software catering the needs of riders. The first functional prototype was ready in spring 2014 which had the basic tracking features onboard including GPS reporting using GPRS technology. 
During 2014 we have continued to work hard on our prototype. We have included more and more features to the current working prototype, and have been designing the final Moto PCB and testing various accessories in order to perfect our product and its connectivity. By early October 2014 we had reached a tipping point where we felt comfortable to launch the project in Kickstarter. We are still constantly working on several improvements and continue testing of the Moto PCB and the working prototype. We will have the product ready in mint condition when delivered to the backers.

 Industrial design
Pictures above show the early design development for the casing and integrated wires. Since then we have continued to fine tune our design alongside the other product development streams and by October we had locked the main casing design principles. Now we are finalizing the casing for the first backer deliveries. The result is a solid and sleek design casing which can tackle the challenges which installation into a motorcycle entails such as moisture, rain, shocks and vibration.
The Tramigo Moto kit delivered to the backers will include a weather proof tracking device with a harness containing the cable for the motorcycle power source, input and output wire as well as Velcro fastener. The input wire can be attached to the bike to activate the ignition sensor while the output wire can be attached to the immobilization sensor and/ or to the siren. An immobilization sensor and a siren are included in the SECURE RIDER reward, and backers choosing other rewards can purchase these accessories from webstores in the spring 2015. We will also deliver to all the backers an English language manual and an installation guide.
Tramigo Moto is easy to install to any bike and the straightforward process goes as follows:

We have conducted field testing in different environments and the pictures above show our test device installation to a team member's motorcycle.
The main milestones ahead of us and keeping our tech and design teams busy relate to the completion of the casing industrial design (Oct-Dec), testing of the Moto PCB (Oct-Dec), development of the Moto Cloud software (Oct-Apr), beta testing of the Tramigo Moto batch run (Jan-Feb) and start the mass production (Apr).
Before the commercial launch of Tramigo Moto we will also design a fresh sales package and launch our Moto Cloud, which is the heart and soul of many of our cool features, including computer, tablet and mobile user interfaces.
In terms of logistics and sourcing of components we have a similar heightened preparedness where we have identified all the necessary components and created a Bill of Materials (BOM) for the final product. Securing component availability as well as the lead-time and cost optimization is undergoing.
We have confidence in the progress made and at the moment have a solid production plan giving us the confidence to launch the Kickstarter campaign and approach all you backers. Our overriding target is to deliver all the backers a completely ready and tested product with the Moto Cloud software ready to track from day one!
Kickstarter community support
We have come a long way thus far, but we still need a final push to be able to bring our unique product to the markets. Here we need the support of the Kickstarter community and we humbly invite everybody to back our story!
Our funding goal stands at US$50,000 meaning that we are reaching out to some 300 riders to step up, back our campaign and be a forerunner in the rider community to help bring motorcycle tracking to the next level. 
The funding from the community will be utilized as follows:
Make possible the development of the Moto Cloud;
Final design work around the new Moto casing;
Enable the first mass production batch; and
Preparation of the new Moto landmark database.
To make this happen we need your help and backing as the production costs for small volumes can be very high putting the product affordability in jeopardy. We have agreed with our component providers that a successful Kickstarter campaign gives us access to lower production costs from the start making it possible to create a quality product with an unbeatable price.
Let's Kickstart Tramigo Moto together!

BlurPort Prototype
The Problem: Unsecured Data & Uncool People
The problem is so widespread that it almost went unnoticed. Millions of people with data that is only protected by a password and millions of people not living up to their coolness potential. You may think these problems are unrelated, but have you ever seen James Bond access his data by typing in the name of his cat? No. Have you ever seen James Bond not being awesome? No. 
This is not a coincidence.
The Solution: Secure Data & Cool People
The BlurPort is a government-grade encrypted USB flash drive for people who are tired of passwords and tired of not having the gadgets promised to us in spy movies. The BlurPort works with a custom app on your iOS or Android device and allows you to protect your data using credentials that are more personal than passwords, and way cooler. What's your mother's maiden name? We don't care. 
Way to protect your data include:
Eye Scanning: Hold the app up to eye-level to authenticate. Provided in partnership with EyeVerify(tm).
Face Scanning: Hold the app up to your face to authenticate.
Location: Set locations in which the drive can be unlocked, such as at work or at a top secret government location.
Near Field Communication: Scan your NFC work-badge to authenticate using a NFC capable phone.
Pattern Drawing: Draw a unique pattern on your phoneâ€™s screen to authenticate. ï¿¼
Problem solved. Your data is more secure than it's ever been and you're the coolest person anyone has ever known.
That's not everything either. The BlurPort is highly expandable. Additions can be made to the modes of authentication as smart phone technology progresses. Storage can be expanded as well, as you can attach your own USB storage into the end of the BlurPort. All data that is transferred to the attached storage will be secured with the same government-grade encryption, just as in the included storage. Each of the userâ€™s third-party USB storage devices can be encrypted based on different modes of authentication as well. The options are limitless.
Forget your passwords, even for websites!
By using the BlurPort with LastPass, you'll never need to remember a password again. Check it out below:
But wait, I already have a drive?
BlurPort Prototype attached to external USB harddrive
Well then the BlurPort is for you, too! As mentioned above, you can plug your USB drive into the end of the BlurPort and it'll secure all of your data. Every single bit! So let's say you have a big boy external harddrive. You can set it up with the BlurPort and be able to secure it with all of the above mentioned modes of authentication. It's like magic! 
How does it work? It's simple!
Plug the BlurPort into your computer.
Launch our app on your smart phone and click on the drive's profile.
Your phone will ask you to scan your eye, or tap your tag, etc depending on what methods you selected when you set up the drive.
Our magic sauce transfers encryption credentials wirelessly over Bluetooth between your smart phone and the BlurPort
Boom! Your drive shows up on your computer!
BlurPort use-case with external harddrive attached
Why We Need Your Help
As with any movement, interest must be gathered. You are the interest and we need you to show that. Even though we're moving smoothly along in development, we still have to finish it all up. Your pledge will be used to finalize the hardware aspect of the BlurPort. The pledge money will be put towards the following: finalization of internal circuitry layout, regulatory approval, enclosure design, prototyping & testing, and manufacturing.
How do I know you can deliver? 
Well that shouldn't be too hard to realize! We've spent countless hours working on making a concept into reality. You can check out some pictures of our prototypes below. The hardware will be finalized by our team. The mobile apps are well under development as well. Everything is in the green light! Still don't believe us? Watch the video above!
BlurPort Prototype Revision 2 (bottom view)
BlurPort Prototype Revision 1 (Proof of Concept)
We've also secured space in the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) in Maryville, Missouri. It's a business incubator where we have access to all sorts of resources, facilities, and people to help out in the process. Wisdom is only a step away.  
Northwest President Dr. John Jasinski and Northwest student Aakash Patel share a handshake after signing an agreement allowing Patel's start-up company, BlurPort LLC, to lease office space in Northwest's Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
Our team is lead by Aakash Patel (aaka.sh), who brings many years of experience in academic and hobbyist hardware and software development. At the CIE, we're surrounded by those who think alike and can provide valuable insight into development. We've grown deep relations with our partners and suppliers over the past half a year, and their engineers are integral to our development process as well. 
The Plan
Firmware will be completed by the end of May. Hardware finalization should occur by June, and will be submitted for regulatory approval afterward. Final enclosure design will be completed by time of hardware finalization. Manufacturing will begin immediately thereafter. If all stays on track, we should ship out final units to pledgees by September
The BlurPort will be assembled in the US
We have a US-based manufacturer ready for our order. Enclosure design will be completed by one of Kansas City's best design firms, so you can rest assured that the BlurPort will be beautiful.
Enterprise features, such as cloud management of users, will be developed soon after initial shipment. 
Tech Specs
iOS and Android compatible.
The BlurPort will come with 8GB of storage.
Uses encryption compatible with US Government information processing standards. All data is secured using AES 256-bit Cypher Block Chain (CBC) algorithm. 
All third-party USB drives that are used with the BlurPort must be USB Mass Storage devices (a vast majority are).
USB 2.0/3.0 compatible. Max theoretical transfer speed is 480Mbps.
Compatible with any desktop operating system that can handle USB Mass Storage devices (pretty much every single one out there!). There's no special software to install.
The BlurPort doesn't care what file-system you use on your drive. It encrypts everything, including the file-system. Once you're authenticated, the BlurPort is transparent.

â€œThe U.S. Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to freedom, independence and protection of personal property.â€ (September 17, 1787)
These fundamental rights were abolished de facto on the internet.
The officeKey iMUNIQE is a well-designed high resolution security device full of tricky, unique encoding software including an intuitive user interface that will work on all devices and operating systems with a USB, micro USB or USB Lightning port and [will offer] smart intelligent apps for all platforms in the near future.
The iMUNIQE key will be a fully blown security product that combines personal, software and hardware information. More importantly, it is user-friendly.
officeKey iMUNIQE is the easiest and most secure way to communicate via the web without having to change your daily routine. You can continue to use your preferred communication channels, including Skype, Dropbox, Salesforce, Outlook, OneCloud, Sharepoint, Google Mail or Facebook.
The iMUNIQE key works like a weapon providing uncompromising online protection for your added value, your data, your ideas and your identity.
It is a dynamic stealth system, regardless of the device and the operating system. You do not have to be online because the iMUNIQE key is a 100% offline solution. All information for the encryption and decryption are located directly on the iMUNIQE key. No other product has this kind of flexibility. Even better: all of the software and hardware components of the iMUNIQE key are one-of-a-kind in this form.
Offline? In an online world? Yes! The iMUNIQE key is much more than a multi-encoding system. ItÂ´s about all of your sensitive data and all of your communication channels. And it authenticates 100% of your communication partners offline â€“ all personally known.
The process is always the same: Only known and authenticated partners will be able to decrypt your encoded content. ThatÂ´s what we call our Highlander principle. Remember the blockbuster with Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and the beautiful Alexandra Vandernoot in the 80Â´s? â€œThere can be only one.â€
Here's how the officeKey iMUNIQE works
Authenticate communication partners and encode sensitive data offline. Simply plug your USB key into your device and link your stick offline with the stick of your chosen communication partner, e. g. tax attorney, bank accountant, project colleague or any other business partner.
OS: Windows, MacOS, Android, IOS, Windows Phone etc.
devices: PCs, smartphones, tablets, notebooks, etc.
transfer access: Wi-Fi, Edge, 3G, LTE, Bluetooth etc.
content: every file Format
Does a security product have to look like one? Definitely not. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve designed the iMUNIQE key like a modern designer piece. It is handy to use, feels comfortable in your hand and is the right size to fit comfortably in your pocket.
You will love the metallic optic. The slide control lets you chose the required connectivity: USB, micro USB or USB Lightning. All-in-all, you will have an IT security product that others will envy. We love our iMUNIQUE key design.
Each iMUNIQE key contains the key material of all your trusted people. The key is thus always bound to you as a person and never to a device such as a laptop, smartphone or tablet. The advantage: you hold the key in your hand, secured with your password, while on the go. This will be of particular interest for companies that want unlimited encrypted communication in projects. And what goes for companies, applies also to your family or friends.
You will get an easy to handle software which runs directly from the key. All necessary keys and recipient data are stored only on the iMUNIQUE key. The iMUNIQE-Key uses the full computing power of your PC or smartphone for encryption and decryption. A small intelligent agent will be installed on each smart device.
Everything you need on the go is directly placed on your iMUNIQE key. Manage your communication partners, decrypt and encrypt sensitive data and protect your key with double authentication (physical key + password / PIN). The complete iMUNIQE technology is security in your pocket.
We didnâ€™t develop a new algorithm, which is the biggest challenge for web participants. Instead, we combined existing algorithms into a new encoding process.
The officeKey iMUNIQE doesnâ€™t require you to use any official public/private key method. First, it uses a special offline method to authenticate your communication partner. Then it allows you to communicate 100% multi-encoded:
3DES
SHA
Rijandel Managed
CRC
AES
The key is useless for anyone who might happen to find it. It requires a password and PIN to be operated. Even on an infiltrated device an attacker would have no way to misuse or steal the data on the keys: the key hardware itself is part of the encryption process.
We started our prototype testing with standard USB sticks and found out that not all existing devices wouldâ€™ meet our technical requirements. Inspired by another of our products â€“ the officeKey CTX Remote â€“ we opted for a branded stick optic. Itâ€™ looked nice, but [needed something] more to appear state-of-the-art. Several 3-D renderings later, we came upon a completely unique stick design with special hardware components.
We searched the market worldwide [for a product with comparable] technical abilities. The result is a high-end security key with hardware and software components that form a deep part of the entire iMUNIQE technology. This is not the end, because we continue to screen and prototype new technologies every day to proof our site of view for well-developed security products. Thatâ€™s not a plan â€“ itâ€™s our attitude towards life!
The officeKey team has a wide range of experience in a variety of projects for many well-known, major national and international companies in the IT, telecommunication, finance, consumer goods and banking industries. Drawing on our many yearsâ€™ experience in developing high-quality secure IT infrastructures, services and products and on our in-depth grasp of the market dynamics, one of our clients (one of the biggest tax consulting companies in Germany) has asked us: â€œHow can we be 100% safe in the world wide web? How can we protect the online communication between our clients and our tax attorneys â€“ especially our email communication?â€ The only correct answer at the time had to be: â€œThere is no such thing as 100% security. But we will search tirelessly to find the best solution.â€ That was back in the summer of 2011.
So we analyzed existing methods and frequently-used algorithms such as AES, 3DES and SHA to try to develop a deeper understanding of customer needs while analyzing the legal requirements and observing what was happening with the other technology companies on the global market. After two years of in-depth research, we found something different from the other existing products.
In January 2013, we hired one of the best cryptography and IT development experts to develop what would become perhaps one of the most important products in the world. We also hired some very experienced strategy, marketing and sales experts who had previously worked for major consulting firms like McKinsey & Company. This top-notch team is the brains behind officeKey iMUNIQE, which has since developed into slightly more than an email encoding solution.
Something very important happened while we were developing officeKey iMUNIQE: Whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed what he knew about the NSAâ€™s data spying in the summer of 2013. We now realized just how important and timely officeKey iMUNIQE really is.
In January 2014, we launched a worldwide anonymous penetration contest. We did this anonymously because we didnâ€™t want it linked back to our company. That was our first public test, so we installed a very savvy platform to collect as much empirical data as possible. Hackers and IT specialists had to decrypt an encoded test file within a period of 60 days. We found participants from places as far-flung as in Singapore, New Delhi, New York, San Francisco, Berlin via Facebook groups, hacking forums, IRC channels and a far-reaching public relations campaign. After the test period, successfully decoders had to report how they had hacked into our test. As an incentive, we offered the first successful hack a prize of $2,500.
This contest was just one of the many other tests and security audits conducted on officeKey iMUNIQE to prove its stability and undecipherability.
Eight thousand hackers in 130 countries could not crack a data packet encrypted with iMUNIQE technology, even though we only use known algorithms. Given our work ethic, we were not satisfied with this. In order to read the data packet by simply trying all theoretically possible keys, you would need 128 years. We are very proud of this achievement.
Why are we making an appeal to you for crowdfunding? The same kind of autonomy you value online is also important to us: we are convinced that we can only develop good software if it meets our ideals. We can only achieve this if we remain absolutely independent.
Weâ€™ve developed the iMUNIQE key to make your everyday online experience safer, happier, easier and more independent from online risks, massive tracking and content recording. It only makes sense to invite everyone to get involved so that officeKey can more quickly achieve more. We think the concept behind the officeKey iMUNIQE technology â€“ effortless offline encoding and decoding of sensitive content and offline authentication of communication partners â€“ is something that everyone can get behind. It takes easy-to-use technology to new dimensions by providing secure email and online communication and document encoding without having to learn new technologies.
Support us in creating something great. Your rules and your belief can move mountains and push the internet to what it used to be: a free, democratic space with no monopoly on information.
Take back ownership of your data and assert your right to digital self-determination by supporting our project financially!
We can provide many of you with your own iMUNIQE key to inspire others and even offer future careers!
Weâ€™ve set a goal of $75,000, which will allow us to begin serial production of the officeKey iMUNIQE with a launch date as soon as December 2014.
We unveiled our working iMUNIQE prototype and its fully functional software to a select group of customers for some alpha tests. Every dollar raised through Kickstarter will go directly to improving the software and manufacturing the iMUNIQE devices.
officeKey is working diligently to ensure that all iMUNIQE pledges are delivered to Kickstarter contributors on time. That being said, delivery of rewards is subject to best efforts.
The social network was yesterday. The future is the immunity network! Tomorrow is officeKey! Tomorrow is you!
We believe in a digital world where everyone will be on an even playing field. We are not against fighting terrorism. On the contrary: we believe and know that official agencies like the NSA and other secret services have power enough to decrypt and record any content they want â€“ and in real-time. But we want to protect you from all other dangers. We want to help you protect your secrets against those who are not authorized to read your information.
And we also believe and know that users have their doubts about existing systems â€“ including you! Edward Snowden proved that our perception and beliefs were correct: thereÂ´s a lot of work to do! Officials and companies have to reinvent the concepts of privacy and immunity. Particularly officials and certification agencies, working in collaboration with secret service agencies around the world, will have to rethink the importance of privacy and immunity in online communication.
In addition, we believe your content shouldnÂ´t be tracked, logged or recorded â€“ neither by us nor by any other third party. ThatÂ´s our golden rule for the age of security: an immunity network.
From the beginning, the internet was designed so that the failure of individual connection nodes could result in the failure of the entire internet. It was kept simple: all of the routers were repeatedly linked so that they could identify their partner without a central authority and communicate with each other. Unfortunately, it is the other way around with the way your data is stored online. You are always in the same location, in the cloud, with your provider or on the servers at Facebook, Google, Apple or Microsoft. If you know the location of third-party data and where these systems are controlled, you can read it, manipulate, analyze and abuse it. You can do whatever you like with this information. And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening every day, everywhere in the world.
TodayÂ´s web-based communications systems are being systematically infiltrated both by government agencies and unofficially through web attacks. Web attacks might be carried out by hackers, but often these hackers are being hired by your competitors. Unfortunately, even though there are strict rules and regulations for government departments such as the US Department of Homeland Security or the UK Home Office, these can be easily bypassed by departments such as the National Security Agency, if they believe they have a need to access your information. The majority of cloud services use server capacity from platforms provided by Apple, Google or Amazon.
The volume of personal and business content is constantly growing and is being transmitted and shared through cloud service platforms such as iCloud, OneCloud, Dropbox or Sharepoint. According to German law, any company that provides any kind of telecommunication services must give German law enforcement access to all data transmitted via their platform/server (Â§110 TKG). Your personal data communications will be decoded, read and then recoded. The result: your personal content is accessible to governmental departments and thus accessible to many companies and hackers and at risk of being leaked.
In other words: every encryption system offered to individuals to date has been worthless.
But what if we give can give you more autonomy, more security and more immunity?
The development of iMUNIQE keys was born from the idea of developing a distributed cryptographic system according to the principles of the internet.
Each key is an autonomous cryptographic token that connects with countless other keys and stores all the connection information offline. There is no central node and thus no way to monitor or intercept the data. The failure of a single iMUNIQE key does not lead to the collapse of the system. This is the start of the next stage of the internetâ€™s evolution â€“ the immunity network!
Any kind of encryption is based on keeping a secret shared only with the people who enjoy your confidence. In earlier times, people deliberately chose places where they would be alone and shared secrets in personal to ensure that only the correct recipient could come into possession of the secret. It was thus impossible for third parties to steal these secrets or misuse them for self-enrichment. Secrets are used to protect your intellectual property and your privacy.
Just like years ago, we believe that now is the moment to start a digital revolution to organize the internet along the same basic values and principles:
Freedom: Many products offering such security are expensive and in many cases only available to a small fraction of internet users. We intend to produce a product that is accessible and affordable to everyone, and not just a minority. Products that depend on your own financial resources are accessible only to a minority. Everyone should be free to determine for themselves to whom they wish to provide access to their information.
Independence: The iMUNIQE key is an independent self-learning system, in the smallest of forms. The user alone decides who will get to use the information and how it will be transmitted. All users and the encryption information are saved within the key as is the encryption software. As it is an independent system, the internet is simply your tool: you use it only to transmit the information, while maintaining control.
Ownership: As previously stated, our aim is to give you something that belongs to you, i.e.user-specific. Only you will have the ability to use the key in combination with your login (password/user name and PIN). And you can fully protect your intellectual property with this combination of login data.

We appreciate your enthusiasm, but there are three important things you should know if you donÂ´t already. These points need to be addressed:
1.There is no such thing as a guaranteed, 100% fully secure protected system.
2.This is not the challenge.
3.The challenge is to increase the time it takes for a man-in-the-middle attack to hack your encoded file.
The result: The longer it takes the less interest the hacker will have in your sensitive data.
By making it harder for hackers to decode the information, we help you keep your information secure. In the end, it will cost the hacker more in time and resources to access the information than the information is actually worth. If itâ€™s not worth gaining access to the information, then they wonâ€™t do it.
Market research has shown that information is [largely] worthless after 60 days. The cyber attacker has to weigh his options:
How valuable is the information?
How much am I willing to invest in technology and computing power to access this information?
How much effort am I willing to put in order to access this information?
Today, it would take a standard computer 128 years to decrypt a file encoded with iMUNIQE technology.

At officeKey, we believe that everybody should have the confidence that they are in control of their data. Thatâ€™s why we have created a product that can help restore this confidence.

With our product, you encrypt your data before sending it via email, Skype, or cloud services like Dropbox or Salesforce.

 And only those people whom you know personally and trust 100% will be able to decrypt this data.
Today, we can communicate anywhere, any time and with any information we want, often using more than one device to access the web. We are in what has been called the digital age, where everybody has their heads down into their mobile devices. The mixture of private and business content is growing by leaps and bounds due to the customization of IT and the cloudification data storage. We take advantage of the wide range of options for accessing the internet at home, on vacation, in the car, standing in line at the supermarket, when hanging out with friends or at business meetings, even while waiting at government offices.
We are now living in a world where all information is being uploaded to the cloud. These cloud servers, although creating a huge advantage for the mobile user, have left companies and individuals more open to cyber-attacks. A very recent example happened just this May, when eBAY had its customer data hacked.
We share project plans, strategies, research and development details, inventions, account balances, meals, holiday pics and our weddings over the web.
Today, standard security products just donÂ´t match the requirements for a modern online communications system. All existing encoding and authentication systems use public keys from official certification agencies such as Verisign or Cisco.
We need to focus on the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks where the victimsâ€™ identities are at risk of being manipulated during the initial phase of encryption. From the moment users send their encryption key to their trusted user, the information is on the open net/web until it reaches the cloud server. This is exactly the moment when the hacker can access and manipulate the usersâ€™ keys; they basically steal the key usersâ€™ identity as well as their recipientâ€™s.
Over 90% of all companies and users in the world do not realize that they have been hacked, tracked or recorded. This happens regardless of OS, devices, access, content or scenario.
If someone would have asked you ten years ago if you wanted to have a machine that would track your every move and everything you do, would you have said yes? And would you willingly pay for it? Welcome to the smartphone.
Over 90% of all companies will not admit to the fact that they are frequently affected by cyber-attacks because they have a reputation to protect. Yes, it may be that their server is secure, but how secure is their data connection to the server?

What is the Padcaster?
The Padcaster is a versatile iPad case made up of an aluminum frame with a removable urethane insert.  The outside of the sturdy frame is lined with 1/4-20 and 3/8-16 threaded holes for attaching lights, an external mic, or other camera gear. 
With accessories attached you'll probably want to use it on a tripod, shoulder mount or some other support, but the frame is wide and heavy enough - though not too heavy - to stand on its own for shooting or viewing. Plus the size and weight of the frame makes handheld shooting more comfortable, giving you a better, steadier grip.
The secure and flexible urethane insert lets you easily pop your iPad into the Padcasterâ€”a snug fit for protection, confidence and steady shooting on-the-go. 
When youâ€™re done filming with the Padcaster, edit your footage with any of the many great editing and effects apps available on the iPad. Then, upload and share your work with the world. Now you can shoot, edit and distribute your HD video right from the iPad, making it ideal for video blogging, journalism and Livestream.  
Why We Need Your Help
The Original Padcaster is already in production, having been funded almost entirely out of pocket by the Padcaster team, but interest has increased in the past few months and we need help in order to meet the demands of our audience. During the last year, the number one question we've been asked is when we will have a Padcaster for the iPad mini. 
With our limited resources, it would be impossible to continue production of the Original Padcaster while simultaneously researching and developing a Padcaster for the iPad mini, so we need your help!
With this campaign, we hope to fund a second full production run of new and improved Original Padcasters, and successfully manufacture a Padcaster for the iPad Mini, thus giving a wider range of iPad owners the opportunity to take advantage of the all-in-one Production Studio experience!
What Makes The Padcaster Different from the Other iPad Videography Cases Out There?
Though the original inspiration for the Padcaster was as a piece of videography equipment, its versatile design has inspired our customers to use it in a variety of ways we never even imagined.
We've seen our product used as a teleprompter and as a cage for a DSLR. We've seen it tricked out with LED lights, and hooked up to watch television in bed, and in the backseat of a car. We've even seen it used by Kelly Croy of Wired Educator as a tool to help disabled children in the classroom.
Over this last year, we've been amazed to see not only the possibilities of this product, but the inventiveness of the people who use it. We can't help but think that the Padcaster for the iPad mini will inspire more creativity.

My name is Michael DeKort and I am asking for your help to finish the construction of an innovative Internet experience. Far different than anything else available today. Jumbawumba provides Personal, Safe, Automated and User Friendly Internet search capability for both Mobile Devices and PCs.
A place where parents and their children, businesses - anyone - can get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. ALL while being safe, secure and UNTRACKED and anonymous to the sites they visit. (Unless Auto Search is requested on an item we will not store any user information at all.)
How invasive is the tracking? This is a new article on this Kickstarter Project.  Look to the right. That is a list of over 100 trackers tracking me as I read this article. If I was using Jumbawumba at the time there would be NONE.
Over 100 Trackers Tracking Kickstarter News Article
 My goal is to create a more secure internet experience so that you can make the Internet work for you.Use it - Don't let it use you. Jumbawumba provides the following features that no other website can match;
- Private Search and Browsing from your search results
- Automatic Search â€“ Receive links to the latest information from anywhere on the Internet. Jumbawumba will search on any item daily or weekly and let you know when new information is available. No longer will you have page through previously viewed results or sites.
- Integrate - All results on to one easy to use Quad page.Jumbawumba provides a unique user interface where News, Web Pages, Images, Videos etc results are all displayed on a single page. No more jumping back and forth between different types of searches.
- Privacy â€“ Jumbawumba prevents sites searched from knowing your identity, or tracking your search history. Your search results are private.
- Notifications - Jumbawumba will notify you when new information is available for topics you have chosen to have automatically searched.
- Meta Search â€“ Jumbawumba uses all major search engines simultaneously, omits the duplicates and presents the data in an easy to use and understand format. (Engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo)
- Bookmarking and Search/Auto Search Archiving - Easy methods to keep track of and access the information you request.
- RSS Integration
- Web Site Change Tracking
- Google News Integration
- Other features possible â€“ email, texting, data storage/back up, parental controls etc
Here is a video of the Website Demo being used live. (The reason it is not live for Kickstarter viewers is that Google limits the daily search quantities in the software development environment. When we go live there will be no limit)

Branding - Independent Revenue Stream
Create a recognizable, marketable and independent revenue generating brand for Jumbawumba and its mascot.
Utilize the brand for product marketing but also for training and entertainment.
Branding Options
Customer and Company Philosophy
Based on my previous experience I believe that I have proven I will defend the publicâ€™s rights to privacy when it matters most.I have also proven I know how to make robust systems that work under the most difficult situations.Having said that no one should escape objective scrutiny. Not even me. The only people who fear scrutiny are those who fear being exposed. Once fully operational Jumbawumba will provide routine third party verification that your searches are safe, secure and Our goal is to listen to our customers and provide the best possible service and performance.
Explanation for the use of the $125k
The $125k we are asking for is to bring the full product to the market. That includes finishing development, hosting, scaling and closing on necessary legal issues. The only feature of the product we may omit in that first phase would be to the metasearch integration.Since Google is over 70% of world search, and that is our primary search engine, we do not see omitting Bing or Yahoo as showstopper for the first release. However should we receive the funds required to integrate that feature we will. Additionally should the funding surpass what is requested we will also employ a marketing strategy that involves national TV advertising. We will communicate the brand and product capabilities every we can.
Risks and challenges
Current Risk Mitigation
There is a live Demo available to see upon request. It displays all the core features. This means there is very little technical risk in completing the product. And since we store no data (photos, video etc) only links we have no significant storage demands.
I have access to developers as well as a development and Go Live start up environment.
I have filed a provisional patent for the product
I have extensive IT Program and Engineering Management experience
Forward Risk
- Scaling for the right amount of users and spare capacity
We intend to deal with this by growing the local or cloud system as the need becomes available. Should the need drive it we will create our own infrastructure. Also - we intend to host outside of the US. (I realize bad people will use my product. Should the US Government, or any other official body, follow proper legal due process we will assist them in their endeavors to find these people. Additionally I will honor the blacklist Google uses to keep people from visiting websites with malware. We will also extend that blacklist for sites the vast majority of society finds objectionable - like child pornography. Basically if you are bad person doing things the most of society would deem objectionable we do not want your business.)
- Some people and businesses may not understand the value of the product or all of the ways they might find it beneficial - We intend to handle this by providing a FAQ with instructions on how to use the site and ideas for people and business to use the automatic search features. We are looking in to having Jumba featured in cartoons to help with this.
- We are dependent on Google and other search engines and the use of their APIs. While we do not anticipate any issues, and see our product as a net positive for Google and others.
With internet and mobile technologies exploding in our lives we never know where our data ends up. There have been numerous articles in the news where hacking leads to personal photos ending up on internet. You hear about sites like revenge porn, where people once trusted post shared photos without their consent for the world to see.
We believe that security should never be an afterthought and you should always own whatâ€™s yours.
So we built SnapOwn, an innovative way to share photos and videos without losing ownership. With SnapOwn, you never lose track of your photos or who is viewing them, itâ€™s secured at all points and you have total control of all your photos, even when shared with friends, family or someone very close.
SnapOwn is a simple to use app that not only makes sharing photos/videos easy but also secure. Its elegant interface ensures ease of use backed by military grade security. With features like Ask-me-first and Let-me-see the sender has complete control over their shared photos and videos.
We have spent over a year perfecting the backbone and the platform of the app and in the process have filed patents for multiple aspects of the app.
We have an alpha version ready for the Android platform and now need your help to build versions for iOS and Windows.
Be part of our story, join us on our journey
How Does SnapOwn Work?
 Features (Platform)
Features (App)
Security is a primary goal for this platform. We have encryption and security built into every component of the solution.
The database on the phone is encrypted using 256 bit AES
Photos/Videos are encrypted using a unique auto-generated 256 bit AES cipher key, the cipher key itself is secured using 4096 bit RSA keys and the encrypted key is stored away from the device in the SnapOwn cloud. Every photo and video has its own unique key.  
All data exchanged between the phones and the SnapOwn cloud is encrypted using multi layers of 256 bit AES and 4096 bit RSA keys  
What this means is that even if you lose your phone your data is always secured. If someone has both the sender and receiver phones, they still cannot access your data. With the rare possibility that our servers get hacked your data is still secured, thatâ€™s how we have built-in the 3 levels of security right into the core of our platform. To access any data through SnapOwn you need all 3 pieces: sender, receiver and the SnapOwn servers.
This feature allows you to send photos which delete after a specified time; the sender decides what the time should be. Timer based photo exchange helps control how long the receiver can view the photo; once the time is up the photo is deleted from the receiver phone forever.
With Ask Me First you can send photos which require your approval before the receiver can view them. This feature allows you to keep track of who views your photo. If you change your mind later, you may decide to block their access.
Send photos which not only need your approval before being viewed, but also allow you to see what the receiver is doing while looking at your photo. If you change your mind at any point, you can immediately stop him or her from viewing. Let me see brings total control and peace of mind in a world of sharing.
SnapOwn always has you in mind, with features like restrict and un-restrict you are always in control of who can and cannot view photos sent by you. With a few clicks you can restrict any of your contact from viewing all photos ever sent by you. This gives you total control of all photos shared using our platform.

It powers up from the new location, finds the WiFi signal, and gets back to its business! In fact, you can even move your cameras between homes, between office and home, or even have some cameras in one home while others are in a different home or office - and have them all be part of the same Sandbox system that you receive alerts from, and that you can monitor on your mobile phone from wherever you might be. 
With Sandbox, you have no more old-fashioned security gear, no long term leases or contracts, no hard selling, no drilling holes and pulling wires, no time consuming and complicated installation. No hardcore sales pitches. And you don't have to live with overpriced home security that is limited to door and window tags, a siren, a keypad, and a yard sign!
Get 24/7 monitoring by a team of professional operators as part of the Sandbox Monthly Services. If there is an intruder or an unverified entry into the house, the operators can notify you and others including the police.
We designed Sandbox to be the most full featured security available - and we made it extremely attractive, usable and affordable.
 
Raven Bicycle Registry is a high tech patent-pending bicycle registration and security status system developed over the past year by seasoned product developer Marshall Lind, MBA, who launched the project after being shocked at seeing a cut lock lying where his bike used to be, one of three stolen in less than six months.
The Raven System, designed with engineering, testing and CAD assistance from Jim Pitchford, was created to combat the widely acknowledged bike theft pandemic by integrating owner-managed online bike accounts with remote Smartphone technology.
Raven Registry can immediately establish or securely alter the security status of any registered bicycle with Smartphone activation of uniquely numbered Near Field Communication (NFC) Tags and QR Codes, PERMANENTLY BONDED to the bicycle's frame and incorporated into the bike owner's Smartcard ID.
With this battery-free System and LIFETIME SERVICE, anyone in the world with an Internet-connected Smartphone can determine when a bicycle has been or is being stolen and to whom the bike belongs. All alert pages display the bike's security status, ownerâ€™s first name, last initial and auto-linking phone number for expediting notification.
Proof of ownership can even be determined without Internet service, by comparing the bikeâ€™s QR sticker account number with the one embossed on the bike ownerâ€™s Smartcard ID.
And, because Raven's convenient, easily operated Smartphone system can be used by any bicycle shopper, enforcement officer, and pawn or bike store personnel, Raven Bike Registry promises to have a profound impact on bike larceny and the sale of stolen bicycles.
NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION (NFC)
Although the media touts Near Field Communication(NFC) as an â€œemergingâ€ technology, itâ€™s the offspring of Radio Frequency ID (RFID), a 1960s identification technology. NFC emerged from the 2006 NFC Forum, a consortium of cell phone manufacturers who agreed to develop technologies operating on a standardized broadcasting frequency of 13.56 MHz, requiring close contact signal operation ideally suited for protecting private information and conserving phone power.  
By 2012 major phone brands offered over 85 Smartphones incorporating NFC system hardware and software (itâ€™s not just an App) and the technology standard continues to stimulate NFC application development. 
Raven's NFC Tag 
The NFC tag used in Ravenâ€™s bike emblem and embedded in our Smartcard ID is an ultra-thin target object NFC Smartphones interrogate consisting of:
Â·1) a capacitor for receiving power from an NFC Smartphone,
Â·2) a microchip encoded with a command string, which in Ravenâ€™s case is your bicycleâ€™s unique IP address (account number).
Â·3) an antenna for transmitting this command back through your Smartphone to your bike's online account security status page.
Because the entire Raven Registry system is battery-free, it can detect a â€œStolenâ€ bicycle even years after it disappears, anywhere in the world thereâ€™s an internet connection.
Our first impulse was to hide our NFC tag from thieves, but its antenna is ineffective encased in metal, and there would still be the problem of communicating Raven tagâ€™s existence to the public in a tamper proof manner . 
We ultimately decided the Raven tag should be located openly to serve as both theft deterrent and detector. Raven designed a lightweight (0.10 oz.), tamper-resistant polycarbonate (bullet proof glass) NFC emblem housing conforming to all down-tube sizes that the owner bonds to the bicycle with our permanent 2-part glue.
Even sanding, scarring or painting Ravenâ€™s emblem body fails to impede the NFC tagâ€™s auto-link capability, since line-of-sight readability is not required.
The emblem can withstand multiple direct hammer blows from any angle and any violent attempts to remove it risks damaging the frame, while leaving obvious evidence the bike is stolen. A quick check of the bicycle's Manufacturer Registration number on Raven's Website will immediately reveals the owner's name and phone number.
QR CODE
Because many current Smartphones, including the iPhone series, still lack NFC technology, we've included a QR Code auto-link component in our Raven Registry System. This opens up system interrogation to virtually all Smartphones, since free QR code Apps have been widely available to all Smartphone platforms since 2010.
On the downside, the QR Code is inadequate as a security product by itself, since it relies on line-of-sight readability, which makes it vulnerable to deliberate or accidental defacement or removal. 
Because we have to leave it exposed Raven decided it should be unidentifiable, as a seemingly useless and obscure sticker offering no indication of its security benefits, except to those informed of Ravenâ€™s System.
This durable, high bond, UV protected outdoor vinyl sticker also offers the only visual indicator of the bikeâ€™s unique account number.
WHY NOT GPS?  
INITIAL PURCHASE- 5X the price of Raven's NFC System.
MONTHLY FEE- Phone service charge of $6 to $10.  
LEGAL- Search warrant for one bicycle? Won't happen!
LIABILITY- Bike thief pursuit can lead to injury or death!
RAVEN'S PRODUCTION GOAL
Raven has set its Kickstarter production goal of 5,000 Raven Registry Kits as one large enough to introduce the Raven System in a meaningful way to the cycling community, while allowing us to take advantage of supplier minimums and cost-effective price-points. 
We currently have over 900 uniquely encoded NFC emblems assembled and packaged together with matching QR code stickers and Smartcard IDs, but we need your Kickstarter support to complete our NFC emblem glue kits, since two-part glue burst-packs cost over $1.20 each and our re-packagers in Houston require a 5,000 unit order minimum.
Kickstarter Launch Date
If you plan on being one of the lucky 900 to receive their Bike Registry kits first, donâ€™t delay. Raven is operating in full gear to get the word out on college campuses and to media, bicycle coalitions, clubs, bike stores and event coordinators.
By Late November
By late November Raven will have finalized and beta tested the Raven Bike Registry Website database system, complete with secure password setups, promotional code tables, integrated Paypal registration, and auto-fill and file replacement activation.
By Late December
With a turn-around time for both our glue burst-packs and specialized sticky glue templates of three weeks, including shipping and Registry Kit assembly, 900 early Kickstarter supporters can expect to receive their Raven Registry Kits and other complimentary biking goodies and special invitations in time to secure their new Holiday bike for the New Year.
By Late January
We currently have 5,000 UV-resistant Raven emblem labels and packages in stock, but our ability to order 4,100 of the remaining Registry Kit components hinges upon Kickstarter support. Our polycarbonate emblems can be produced and air-shipped from our Chinese supplier in less than a week, but serial numbered NTAG Smartcards printed by our NFC supplier in Seattle have a turnaround time of 3 weeks. Add another week for QR Code encoding, account setup and Registry Kit assembly here in San Jose.  A successful Kickstarter campaign can get us started early on those kits, so cyclists can receive their Raven Bike Registry kits by late January.
With your support we hope to be working frantically with smiles on our faces all the way through the holidays. 
YOUR RAVEN REGISTRY KIT(s) will include:
1.) A polycarbonate bike emblem with NFC tag shielded by our UV resistant polyester Raven label. 
2.) A QR code UV-resistant outdoor sticker with printed account number. 
3.) An account-matching Smartcard ID with imbedded NFC tag, printed QR code, embossed account number and signature strip. 
4.) An emblem glue kit containing a Glue Guide and Spreader, a glue burst-pack, 60 grit sanding pad and alcohol prep patch. 
5.) Unlimited Raven account service
SETTING UP BIKE ACCOUNTS
After bonding your Raven Bike emblem(s) and QR Code(s) to your bicycle(s) as instructed, return to www.ravenbikeregistry.com to activate your account(s) by either auto-linking via Smartphone through your bike's NFC tag or QR Code or by entering any of your assigned account numbers where indicated on Raven Registryâ€™s home page.
ACTIVATION 
Your e-mail address and a secure password you select will open your dedicated account management page, which lists all uniquely numbered accounts corresponding to the Registry Kit(s) you received. The accounts are only assigned to bicycles once all relevant bike and owner information is provided. A bike owner's name listed under each account may differ from the registrarâ€™s in first name only, allowing family members to register bicycles under a single management account.
The final step involves activating your bikeâ€™s security status alert page to be seen by anyone interrogating the bikeâ€™s Raven emblem or QR Code. The choices are â€œSecureâ€, â€œFor Saleâ€ and â€œStolenâ€, with â€œAccount De-Activatedâ€ available on subsequent account visits when a bike is sold, recycled or given away. Any transfer of a Raven registered bicycle requires a simple secure re-registry to avoid ownership/theft disputes.
Raven will soon have instructional videos on YouTube demonstrating nonthreatening methods for thwarting a bike theft in progress.
In keeping with all great start-ups, Marshall Lind and Jim Pitchford developed, tested and refined the Raven Bike Registry (RBR) status system in a Silicon Valley home office/garage, shared by an Alaskan Malamute and a Chocolate Lab.
Marshall, Raven Protech Inc.â€™s CEO, designed and developed the RBR System and integrated Website design, including graphics interface, user navigation and registration processes at www.ravenbikeregistry.com. He is also directing and coordinating business operations and contract suppliers and is spearheading marketing, PR, sales and special events efforts and initiatives.
Marshall has an MBA and over 20 years of product and service development experience, beginning in 1993 with the design and creation of DESK-DINOS, a dinosaur desk accessory line he manufactured in Shanghai, China and sold to Walmart, Sony and hundreds of retailers nationwide.
In 2000, Marshall shifted to Internet-based marketing projects, most recently serving as Director of Arts In Tulsa for eight years, a member-supported online arts organization he founded to provide electronic media services and support to over 135 artists.
Jim, Raven Protech Inc.â€™s COO, is responsible for decorating the garage floor with polycarbonate emblem housings as he aggressively tested the bonding capabilities of more than a dozen brands of â€œpermanentâ€ glues and VHB tapes on bicycle frames (See Glue Challenge below). He also produced the emblem housingâ€™s CAD design and has provided invaluable consulting assistance at every stage of Raven Registryâ€™s development process.
Jim is a manufacturing process engineer with over 25 years of engineering management, machine programming and part production experience in Silicon Valley with Micro-Mechanics Inc. and IBM. At Raven, Jim will serve as Senior Operations Director, with responsibilities that include working within a flexible production framework initially dependent on building relationships and supervising subcontract production and assembly companies until product demand and economies of scale justify shifting RBR Kit operations in-house.
Gil Garcia is responsible for Raven Registryâ€™s database development, a San Jose State MBA graduate whose stellar programming talent secured contract work at NASA, E-Bay and a number of promising Silicon Valley start-ups.
Our biggest hurtle involved finding a suitable emblem adhesive for bonding polycarbonate to bike frame surfaces while exhibiting the superior peel-away strength required to repel assault.
Jim initially employed his custom-fabricated mechanism to apply and measure the shear and peel strengths of the industrial adhesives and VHB Tapes tested. Once our selection narrowed, he subsequently subjected emblems to methods used by bike thieves, essentially blunt-force trauma with hammer and chisel. Ultimately we selected a clear glue so resilient it literally fuses polycarbonate to the bonding surface. 
Since the two-part glue is permanent, we took special care to simplify the gluing process by including concise instructions and gluing tools in every Raven Registry Kit. Ravenâ€™s â€œBikerâ€™s Snotâ€ glue is packaged in a pre-mix burst pack and our sticky Glue Guide helps pinpoint the exact phone-accessible location on the bikeâ€™s down-tube for the Raven emblem.  
For maximum adhesion, we strongly recommend sanding through the bicycle's clear coat and paint layers using the Glue Guide. This is especially critical on older and/or inexpensive bikes because multiple layers may have been applied improperly or lost their cohesive integrity. Donâ€™t worry, the exposed surface will be completely covered by your Raven emblem. 
The entire gluing process takes less than five minutes and both the glueâ€™s hard, rubber-like consistency and glue guide make clean-up a cinch. Our upcoming online gluing instruction video will fully explain the process.
Initial market feedback suggests our lifetime registry price of $34.95 for Ravenâ€™s sophisticated Smartphone registration and security status system is extremely attractive and conducive to achieving our ultimate objective of saturating bike owner markets to eliminate bike theft.
So Kickstarter supporters get an even better deal!
Our sales model relies primarily on Internet orders, with bike owners driven to Ravenâ€™s Website in a bid to help Raven control bike registration and track sales. We'll also be engaging Bike shops as a valuable resource for promoting the Raven System in ways beneficial to both them and their customers through sales and customer service assistance involving Emblem application and bike owner registration.
Ravenâ€™s marketing and sales efforts will concentrate on college campuses, bike clubs and organizations, ride share and bike rental programs, and bicycle races, rides and events. While much of our initial efforts will focus on after-market bikes, our patent-pending status and strengthening brand recognition will eventually allow us to convince bike manufacturers to integrate the Raven NFC tags into their bike designs. 
Since weâ€™ve already been contacted by a European cyclist racing organization interested in equipping over 2,200 cyclists with the Raven Registry security system, Raven also plans to introduce the Raven Registry System to Europe by next fall. 
In time Ravenâ€™s patent pending Security Status System will protect all of your valuable personal and business property possessions.

Tramigo Moto speaks several languages which are: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish. Check out the campaign video with subtitles.
Tramigo Moto is a complete motorbike solution consisting of the device wrapped in an integrated casing and software, all purpose-built for riders. Tramigo Moto will connect your ride and trips online and increases the protection of your bike. The integrated casing and wires make it very easy to install, and the available accessories will add an extra layer of security to your bike.
Tramigo Moto is first and foremost designed to be used in a motorcycle and it includes specific motorcycle features and purpose-built casing. However, Tramigo Moto is designed to function also as a multi-purpose device which can be attached to any kind of motorized vehicle which runs with a 12V battery. Besides your motorcycle, you can attach the device to your scooter, ATV, car or even to a snowmobile!
Tramigo Moto is easy to install to any motorcycle thanks to its harness containing the power cables and I/O wires. This harness installation make it equally easy to remove the device from the motorcycle and attach it to another type of vehicle. The harness is attached to the actual device via a socket using a plug which is easy to plug in and plug out. It Is equally easy to remove the device from the Velcro fasteners.  
New reward MULTI RIDER has been added to serve the needs of riders who enjoy riding multiple vehicles. The reward includes up to three (3) sets of harness and Velcros so you can install the harness to all your vehicles making it convenient to switch Tramigo Moto from one vehicle to another. If you happen to own, besides a motorcycle, say an ATV, you can use Tramigo Moto with both of your vehicles. Just plug out the socket and detach the device from the Velcro and install Tramigo Moto to your ATV and you are all set to ride, track and share your ATV with Tramigo Moto. No matter what your ride is, you can track it with Tramigo Moto and share your adventures using Moto Cloud.
For all Kickstarter backers we offer our Moto Cloud free of charge. The Moto Cloud is a real-time software showing you the current status of your motorcycle, alarms and trip information. The Moto Cloud software can be used with any kind of web browser as both mobile and desktop devices are supported. Tramigo Moto and Moto Cloud together will give riders a great user experience and access to a full range of services. Once you have a SIM card with mobile data plan for Tramigo Moto, you are all set to use Moto Cloud!
Tramigo Landmark Data ("TLD") is an exclusively global location database designed and developed for Tramigo tracking devices. Tramigo Moto includes built-in TLD information that generalizes the exact location of the device into a commonly known vicinity and area. Landmarks are chosen so that locally everyone knows them and have an immediate idea of their whereabouts.
TLD landmark concept:
Available in every country in the world;
Multilingual;
Globally harmonized format and standard;
Perfected for instant tracking, both online and offline; and
Cities, towns, villages and information rich POI landmarks.
No more complicated coordinates and slow use of digital maps, but location instantly understood with Moto TLD!
Moto TLD â€“ serves and helps riders
Tramigo shares its landmark experience and know-how with riders and the Kickstarter community. The newly developed Moto TLD includes specific moto landmarks offering plenty of valuable information for riders along popular motorcycle routes, attractions and cities. Initially these moto landmarks will cover North America and Europe and the coverage will be expanded shortly to match countries with meaningful amount of Tramigo Motos in use.
LEAVE A MARK reward gives backers the opportunity to contribute their own landmark(s) which will be included in the Moto TLD from day one! Our Moto Cloud combined with Moto TLD enable the following value-adding features:
Tramigo Moto uses the mobile phone network for data and text message transmission meaning that you need to have a network subscription for Tramigo Moto. The backers need to acquire a SIM card from their own mobile operator and are responsible for the connectivity expenses. We have done our utmost to keep data usage of Tramigo Moto as low as possible and you should be able to use the device for a month with only 10MB of data. We have a vast experience from different mobile operators across the globe, and prior to the reward delivery we will provide all backers our recommendations on which mobile operator to use.
The use of all Tramigo Moto and Moto Cloud features require a SIM card which has both SMS (direct inquiries using mobile phone) and data (use of Moto Cloud) credit. Backers will receive the access to Moto Cloud software for free. The beauty of the text message (SMS) communication is that no critical alert from your bike will go unnoticed due to lack of internet access!
Tramigo Motoâ€™s simple tracking functionalities can be used without a data plan and without Moto Cloud, using any mobile phone SIM-card having text message capability as the device location and status can be checked with a simple text message from your mobile phone. Text messages are very inexpensive in most countries, especially within your own network when you have the same mobile operator for your own mobile phone and Tramigo Moto.
In the future we are planning to open a programming interface (API) for tech savvy to create their own applications to utilize the data created by Tramigo Moto.
Tramigo Moto can be used anywhere in the world where GSM cellular networks exist. So backers from all over the world are most welcome to back our campaign. Countries where we cannot unfortunately offer Tramigo Moto at the moment include South Korea and Japan.
Tramigo Ltd, the manufacturer of Tramigo Moto, had encountered frequent inquiries from the motorcycle community ever since it launched its first portable 'T21' model in 2005. Although not originally designed for motorcycle use and with no special motorcycle features or connectors, these inquiries were motivated by the obvious customer need. We have reason to believe that there are still a few pioneer riders out there with 'T21' installed!
The motorbike product demand increased year-by-year and later in 2008, after the launch of the new 'T22' model, Tramigo developed a do-it-yourself kit and designed a separate rugged casing to this automotive device to provide some motorcycle tailoring. This was a good start, but not enough!
The continuous dialogue with riders encouraged our team founder Markus Vajanne to embark on a full-scale motorcycle product R&D project about a year ago, back in late 2013. Markus put the team together in order to squeeze out all the know-how within the fields of technology, positioning, design and software development and mix that with the landmark concept widely used by Tramigo in automotive tracking in order to create something truly unique, value-adding and custom-made for motorcycle owners. Tramigo Moto combines our teamâ€™s extensive vehicle tracking experience and design expertise and is a high-quality yet affordable motorcycle safety product designed for riders! 
Our experience
With thousands of tracking devices delivered since 2002 to our satisfied customers, Tramigo has acquired unique knowledge in how to deliver a tracking solution that really works. Now this knowledge is put into use to create a new way to do motorcycle tracking. We strongly believe we have created a new benchmark device for all you riders. Each new product development project has its unique challenges but our strong experience in manufacturing, logistics and customer support gives us confidence that we can deliver what we promise. With your backing we will be able to deliver you the ultimate tracking device to keep your ride safe and make riding more fun!
When our team started the development of Tramigo Moto, a decision was made to create a new Moto PCB and design an integrated motorcycle product. A product that has the features and the software catering the needs of riders. The first functional prototype was ready in spring 2014 which had the basic tracking features onboard including GPS reporting using GPRS technology. 
During 2014 we have continued to work hard on our prototype. We have included more and more features to the current working prototype, and have been designing the final Moto PCB and testing various accessories in order to perfect our product and its connectivity. By early October 2014 we had reached a tipping point where we felt comfortable to launch the project in Kickstarter. We are still constantly working on several improvements and continue testing of the Moto PCB and the working prototype. We will have the product ready in mint condition when delivered to the backers.

 Industrial design
Pictures above show the early design development for the casing and integrated wires. Since then we have continued to fine tune our design alongside the other product development streams and by October we had locked the main casing design principles. Now we are finalizing the casing for the first backer deliveries. The result is a solid and sleek design casing which can tackle the challenges which installation into a motorcycle entails such as moisture, rain, shocks and vibration.
The Tramigo Moto kit delivered to the backers will include a weather proof tracking device with a harness containing the cable for the motorcycle power source, input and output wire as well as Velcro fastener. The input wire can be attached to the bike to activate the ignition sensor while the output wire can be attached to the immobilization sensor and/ or to the siren. An immobilization sensor and a siren are included in the SECURE RIDER reward, and backers choosing other rewards can purchase these accessories from webstores in the spring 2015. We will also deliver to all the backers an English language manual and an installation guide.
Tramigo Moto is easy to install to any bike and the straightforward process goes as follows:

We have conducted field testing in different environments and the pictures above show our test device installation to a team member's motorcycle.
The main milestones ahead of us and keeping our tech and design teams busy relate to the completion of the casing industrial design (Oct-Dec), testing of the Moto PCB (Oct-Dec), development of the Moto Cloud software (Oct-Apr), beta testing of the Tramigo Moto batch run (Jan-Feb) and start the mass production (Apr).
Before the commercial launch of Tramigo Moto we will also design a fresh sales package and launch our Moto Cloud, which is the heart and soul of many of our cool features, including computer, tablet and mobile user interfaces.
In terms of logistics and sourcing of components we have a similar heightened preparedness where we have identified all the necessary components and created a Bill of Materials (BOM) for the final product. Securing component availability as well as the lead-time and cost optimization is undergoing.
We have confidence in the progress made and at the moment have a solid production plan giving us the confidence to launch the Kickstarter campaign and approach all you backers. Our overriding target is to deliver all the backers a completely ready and tested product with the Moto Cloud software ready to track from day one!
Kickstarter community support
We have come a long way thus far, but we still need a final push to be able to bring our unique product to the markets. Here we need the support of the Kickstarter community and we humbly invite everybody to back our story!
Our funding goal stands at US$50,000 meaning that we are reaching out to some 300 riders to step up, back our campaign and be a forerunner in the rider community to help bring motorcycle tracking to the next level. 
The funding from the community will be utilized as follows:
Make possible the development of the Moto Cloud;
Final design work around the new Moto casing;
Enable the first mass production batch; and
Preparation of the new Moto landmark database.
To make this happen we need your help and backing as the production costs for small volumes can be very high putting the product affordability in jeopardy. We have agreed with our component providers that a successful Kickstarter campaign gives us access to lower production costs from the start making it possible to create a quality product with an unbeatable price.
Let's Kickstart Tramigo Moto together!

BlurPort Prototype
The Problem: Unsecured Data & Uncool People
The problem is so widespread that it almost went unnoticed. Millions of people with data that is only protected by a password and millions of people not living up to their coolness potential. You may think these problems are unrelated, but have you ever seen James Bond access his data by typing in the name of his cat? No. Have you ever seen James Bond not being awesome? No. 
This is not a coincidence.
The Solution: Secure Data & Cool People
The BlurPort is a government-grade encrypted USB flash drive for people who are tired of passwords and tired of not having the gadgets promised to us in spy movies. The BlurPort works with a custom app on your iOS or Android device and allows you to protect your data using credentials that are more personal than passwords, and way cooler. What's your mother's maiden name? We don't care. 
Way to protect your data include:
Eye Scanning: Hold the app up to eye-level to authenticate. Provided in partnership with EyeVerify(tm).
Face Scanning: Hold the app up to your face to authenticate.
Location: Set locations in which the drive can be unlocked, such as at work or at a top secret government location.
Near Field Communication: Scan your NFC work-badge to authenticate using a NFC capable phone.
Pattern Drawing: Draw a unique pattern on your phoneâ€™s screen to authenticate. ï¿¼
Problem solved. Your data is more secure than it's ever been and you're the coolest person anyone has ever known.
That's not everything either. The BlurPort is highly expandable. Additions can be made to the modes of authentication as smart phone technology progresses. Storage can be expanded as well, as you can attach your own USB storage into the end of the BlurPort. All data that is transferred to the attached storage will be secured with the same government-grade encryption, just as in the included storage. Each of the userâ€™s third-party USB storage devices can be encrypted based on different modes of authentication as well. The options are limitless.

BlurPort Prototype Revision 2 (bottom view)
BlurPort Prototype Revision 1 (Proof of Concept)
We've also secured space in the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) in Maryville, Missouri. It's a business incubator where we have access to all sorts of resources, facilities, and people to help out in the process. Wisdom is only a step away.  
Northwest President Dr. John Jasinski and Northwest student Aakash Patel share a handshake after signing an agreement allowing Patel's start-up company, BlurPort LLC, to lease office space in Northwest's Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
Our team is lead by Aakash Patel (aaka.sh), who brings many years of experience in academic and hobbyist hardware and software development. At the CIE, we're surrounded by those who think alike and can provide valuable insight into development. We've grown deep relations with our partners and suppliers over the past half a year, and their engineers are integral to our development process as well. 
The Plan
Firmware will be completed by the end of May. Hardware finalization should occur by June, and will be submitted for regulatory approval afterward. Final enclosure design will be completed by time of hardware finalization. Manufacturing will begin immediately thereafter. If all stays on track, we should ship out final units to pledgees by September
The BlurPort will be assembled in the US
We have a US-based manufacturer ready for our order. Enclosure design will be completed by one of Kansas City's best design firms, so you can rest assured that the BlurPort will be beautiful.
Enterprise features, such as cloud management of users, will be developed soon after initial shipment. 
Tech Specs
iOS and Android compatible.
The BlurPort will come with 8GB of storage.
Uses encryption compatible with US Government information processing standards. All data is secured using AES 256-bit Cypher Block Chain (CBC) algorithm. 
All third-party USB drives that are used with the BlurPort must be USB Mass Storage devices (a vast majority are).
USB 2.0/3.0 compatible. Max theoretical transfer speed is 480Mbps.
Compatible with any desktop operating system that can handle USB Mass Storage devices (pretty much every single one out there!). There's no special software to install.
The BlurPort doesn't care what file-system you use on your drive. It encrypts everything, including the file-system. Once you're authenticated, the BlurPort is transparent.

Here are the functional prototypes we have:
AnonyStik Prototype - A
AnonyStik Prototype - B
AnonyStik Prototype - C
Why Launch a Kickstarter?
We have taken this project as far as we can using the startup funds that we have. Now we are asking for your support and help to fund this project and help us finish it. 
Your funding will allow us do the following:
 Conduct final testing on the device to make sure we solve any bugs or issues. 
We intend on producing AnonyStik in house to ensure the integrity and quality of the product, so we need to purchase tools and equipment that are required for production and building an inventory. 
Plan for future features and enhancements.
We need your help to promote the product and raise awareness so that together we can help people protect their online security and privacy.
AnonyStik is almost finished. Through your support, we have no doubt that this project will be completed on time. We intend to ship early bird rewards by June 2015.

Offline? In an online world? Yes! The iMUNIQE key is much more than a multi-encoding system. ItÂ´s about all of your sensitive data and all of your communication channels. And it authenticates 100% of your communication partners offline â€“ all personally known.
The process is always the same: Only known and authenticated partners will be able to decrypt your encoded content. ThatÂ´s what we call our Highlander principle. Remember the blockbuster with Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and the beautiful Alexandra Vandernoot in the 80Â´s? â€œThere can be only one.â€
Here's how the officeKey iMUNIQE works
Authenticate communication partners and encode sensitive data offline. Simply plug your USB key into your device and link your stick offline with the stick of your chosen communication partner, e. g. tax attorney, bank accountant, project colleague or any other business partner.
OS: Windows, MacOS, Android, IOS, Windows Phone etc.
devices: PCs, smartphones, tablets, notebooks, etc.
transfer access: Wi-Fi, Edge, 3G, LTE, Bluetooth etc.
content: every file Format
Does a security product have to look like one? Definitely not. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve designed the iMUNIQE key like a modern designer piece. It is handy to use, feels comfortable in your hand and is the right size to fit comfortably in your pocket.
You will love the metallic optic. The slide control lets you chose the required connectivity: USB, micro USB or USB Lightning. All-in-all, you will have an IT security product that others will envy. We love our iMUNIQUE key design.
Each iMUNIQE key contains the key material of all your trusted people. The key is thus always bound to you as a person and never to a device such as a laptop, smartphone or tablet. The advantage: you hold the key in your hand, secured with your password, while on the go. This will be of particular interest for companies that want unlimited encrypted communication in projects. And what goes for companies, applies also to your family or friends.
You will get an easy to handle software which runs directly from the key. All necessary keys and recipient data are stored only on the iMUNIQUE key. The iMUNIQE-Key uses the full computing power of your PC or smartphone for encryption and decryption. A small intelligent agent will be installed on each smart device.
Everything you need on the go is directly placed on your iMUNIQE key. Manage your communication partners, decrypt and encrypt sensitive data and protect your key with double authentication (physical key + password / PIN). The complete iMUNIQE technology is security in your pocket.
We didnâ€™t develop a new algorithm, which is the biggest challenge for web participants. Instead, we combined existing algorithms into a new encoding process.
The officeKey iMUNIQE doesnâ€™t require you to use any official public/private key method. First, it uses a special offline method to authenticate your communication partner. Then it allows you to communicate 100% multi-encoded:
3DES
SHA
Rijandel Managed
CRC
AES
The key is useless for anyone who might happen to find it. It requires a password and PIN to be operated. Even on an infiltrated device an attacker would have no way to misuse or steal the data on the keys: the key hardware itself is part of the encryption process.
We started our prototype testing with standard USB sticks and found out that not all existing devices wouldâ€™ meet our technical requirements. Inspired by another of our products â€“ the officeKey CTX Remote â€“ we opted for a branded stick optic. Itâ€™ looked nice, but [needed something] more to appear state-of-the-art. Several 3-D renderings later, we came upon a completely unique stick design with special hardware components.
We searched the market worldwide [for a product with comparable] technical abilities. The result is a high-end security key with hardware and software components that form a deep part of the entire iMUNIQE technology. This is not the end, because we continue to screen and prototype new technologies every day to proof our site of view for well-developed security products. Thatâ€™s not a plan â€“ itâ€™s our attitude towards life!
The officeKey team has a wide range of experience in a variety of projects for many well-known, major national and international companies in the IT, telecommunication, finance, consumer goods and banking industries. Drawing on our many yearsâ€™ experience in developing high-quality secure IT infrastructures, services and products and on our in-depth grasp of the market dynamics, one of our clients (one of the biggest tax consulting companies in Germany) has asked us: â€œHow can we be 100% safe in the world wide web? How can we protect the online communication between our clients and our tax attorneys â€“ especially our email communication?â€ The only correct answer at the time had to be: â€œThere is no such thing as 100% security. But we will search tirelessly to find the best solution.â€ That was back in the summer of 2011.
So we analyzed existing methods and frequently-used algorithms such as AES, 3DES and SHA to try to develop a deeper understanding of customer needs while analyzing the legal requirements and observing what was happening with the other technology companies on the global market. After two years of in-depth research, we found something different from the other existing products.
In January 2013, we hired one of the best cryptography and IT development experts to develop what would become perhaps one of the most important products in the world. We also hired some very experienced strategy, marketing and sales experts who had previously worked for major consulting firms like McKinsey & Company. This top-notch team is the brains behind officeKey iMUNIQE, which has since developed into slightly more than an email encoding solution.
Something very important happened while we were developing officeKey iMUNIQE: Whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed what he knew about the NSAâ€™s data spying in the summer of 2013. We now realized just how important and timely officeKey iMUNIQE really is.
In January 2014, we launched a worldwide anonymous penetration contest. We did this anonymously because we didnâ€™t want it linked back to our company. That was our first public test, so we installed a very savvy platform to collect as much empirical data as possible. Hackers and IT specialists had to decrypt an encoded test file within a period of 60 days. We found participants from places as far-flung as in Singapore, New Delhi, New York, San Francisco, Berlin via Facebook groups, hacking forums, IRC channels and a far-reaching public relations campaign. After the test period, successfully decoders had to report how they had hacked into our test. As an incentive, we offered the first successful hack a prize of $2,500.
This contest was just one of the many other tests and security audits conducted on officeKey iMUNIQE to prove its stability and undecipherability.
Eight thousand hackers in 130 countries could not crack a data packet encrypted with iMUNIQE technology, even though we only use known algorithms. Given our work ethic, we were not satisfied with this. In order to read the data packet by simply trying all theoretically possible keys, you would need 128 years. We are very proud of this achievement.
Why are we making an appeal to you for crowdfunding? The same kind of autonomy you value online is also important to us: we are convinced that we can only develop good software if it meets our ideals. We can only achieve this if we remain absolutely independent.
Weâ€™ve developed the iMUNIQE key to make your everyday online experience safer, happier, easier and more independent from online risks, massive tracking and content recording. It only makes sense to invite everyone to get involved so that officeKey can more quickly achieve more. We think the concept behind the officeKey iMUNIQE technology â€“ effortless offline encoding and decoding of sensitive content and offline authentication of communication partners â€“ is something that everyone can get behind. It takes easy-to-use technology to new dimensions by providing secure email and online communication and document encoding without having to learn new technologies.
Support us in creating something great. Your rules and your belief can move mountains and push the internet to what it used to be: a free, democratic space with no monopoly on information.
Take back ownership of your data and assert your right to digital self-determination by supporting our project financially!
We can provide many of you with your own iMUNIQE key to inspire others and even offer future careers!
Weâ€™ve set a goal of $75,000, which will allow us to begin serial production of the officeKey iMUNIQE with a launch date as soon as December 2014.
We unveiled our working iMUNIQE prototype and its fully functional software to a select group of customers for some alpha tests. Every dollar raised through Kickstarter will go directly to improving the software and manufacturing the iMUNIQE devices.
officeKey is working diligently to ensure that all iMUNIQE pledges are delivered to Kickstarter contributors on time. That being said, delivery of rewards is subject to best efforts.
The social network was yesterday. The future is the immunity network! Tomorrow is officeKey! Tomorrow is you!
We believe in a digital world where everyone will be on an even playing field. We are not against fighting terrorism. On the contrary: we believe and know that official agencies like the NSA and other secret services have power enough to decrypt and record any content they want â€“ and in real-time. But we want to protect you from all other dangers. We want to help you protect your secrets against those who are not authorized to read your information.
And we also believe and know that users have their doubts about existing systems â€“ including you! Edward Snowden proved that our perception and beliefs were correct: thereÂ´s a lot of work to do! Officials and companies have to reinvent the concepts of privacy and immunity. Particularly officials and certification agencies, working in collaboration with secret service agencies around the world, will have to rethink the importance of privacy and immunity in online communication.
In addition, we believe your content shouldnÂ´t be tracked, logged or recorded â€“ neither by us nor by any other third party. ThatÂ´s our golden rule for the age of security: an immunity network.
From the beginning, the internet was designed so that the failure of individual connection nodes could result in the failure of the entire internet. It was kept simple: all of the routers were repeatedly linked so that they could identify their partner without a central authority and communicate with each other. Unfortunately, it is the other way around with the way your data is stored online. You are always in the same location, in the cloud, with your provider or on the servers at Facebook, Google, Apple or Microsoft. If you know the location of third-party data and where these systems are controlled, you can read it, manipulate, analyze and abuse it. You can do whatever you like with this information. And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening every day, everywhere in the world.
TodayÂ´s web-based communications systems are being systematically infiltrated both by government agencies and unofficially through web attacks. Web attacks might be carried out by hackers, but often these hackers are being hired by your competitors. Unfortunately, even though there are strict rules and regulations for government departments such as the US Department of Homeland Security or the UK Home Office, these can be easily bypassed by departments such as the National Security Agency, if they believe they have a need to access your information. The majority of cloud services use server capacity from platforms provided by Apple, Google or Amazon.
The volume of personal and business content is constantly growing and is being transmitted and shared through cloud service platforms such as iCloud, OneCloud, Dropbox or Sharepoint. According to German law, any company that provides any kind of telecommunication services must give German law enforcement access to all data transmitted via their platform/server (Â§110 TKG). Your personal data communications will be decoded, read and then recoded. The result: your personal content is accessible to governmental departments and thus accessible to many companies and hackers and at risk of being leaked.
In other words: every encryption system offered to individuals to date has been worthless.
But what if we give can give you more autonomy, more security and more immunity?
The development of iMUNIQE keys was born from the idea of developing a distributed cryptographic system according to the principles of the internet.
Each key is an autonomous cryptographic token that connects with countless other keys and stores all the connection information offline. There is no central node and thus no way to monitor or intercept the data. The failure of a single iMUNIQE key does not lead to the collapse of the system. This is the start of the next stage of the internetâ€™s evolution â€“ the immunity network!
Any kind of encryption is based on keeping a secret shared only with the people who enjoy your confidence. In earlier times, people deliberately chose places where they would be alone and shared secrets in personal to ensure that only the correct recipient could come into possession of the secret. It was thus impossible for third parties to steal these secrets or misuse them for self-enrichment. Secrets are used to protect your intellectual property and your privacy.
Just like years ago, we believe that now is the moment to start a digital revolution to organize the internet along the same basic values and principles:
Freedom: Many products offering such security are expensive and in many cases only available to a small fraction of internet users. We intend to produce a product that is accessible and affordable to everyone, and not just a minority. Products that depend on your own financial resources are accessible only to a minority. Everyone should be free to determine for themselves to whom they wish to provide access to their information.
Independence: The iMUNIQE key is an independent self-learning system, in the smallest of forms. The user alone decides who will get to use the information and how it will be transmitted. All users and the encryption information are saved within the key as is the encryption software. As it is an independent system, the internet is simply your tool: you use it only to transmit the information, while maintaining control.
Ownership: As previously stated, our aim is to give you something that belongs to you, i.e.user-specific. Only you will have the ability to use the key in combination with your login (password/user name and PIN). And you can fully protect your intellectual property with this combination of login data.

We appreciate your enthusiasm, but there are three important things you should know if you donÂ´t already. These points need to be addressed:
1.There is no such thing as a guaranteed, 100% fully secure protected system.
2.This is not the challenge.
3.The challenge is to increase the time it takes for a man-in-the-middle attack to hack your encoded file.
The result: The longer it takes the less interest the hacker will have in your sensitive data.
By making it harder for hackers to decode the information, we help you keep your information secure. In the end, it will cost the hacker more in time and resources to access the information than the information is actually worth. If itâ€™s not worth gaining access to the information, then they wonâ€™t do it.
Market research has shown that information is [largely] worthless after 60 days. The cyber attacker has to weigh his options:
How valuable is the information?
How much am I willing to invest in technology and computing power to access this information?
How much effort am I willing to put in order to access this information?
Today, it would take a standard computer 128 years to decrypt a file encoded with iMUNIQE technology.

At officeKey, we believe that everybody should have the confidence that they are in control of their data. Thatâ€™s why we have created a product that can help restore this confidence.

With our product, you encrypt your data before sending it via email, Skype, or cloud services like Dropbox or Salesforce.

 And only those people whom you know personally and trust 100% will be able to decrypt this data.
Today, we can communicate anywhere, any time and with any information we want, often using more than one device to access the web. We are in what has been called the digital age, where everybody has their heads down into their mobile devices. The mixture of private and business content is growing by leaps and bounds due to the customization of IT and the cloudification data storage. We take advantage of the wide range of options for accessing the internet at home, on vacation, in the car, standing in line at the supermarket, when hanging out with friends or at business meetings, even while waiting at government offices.
We are now living in a world where all information is being uploaded to the cloud. These cloud servers, although creating a huge advantage for the mobile user, have left companies and individuals more open to cyber-attacks. A very recent example happened just this May, when eBAY had its customer data hacked.
We share project plans, strategies, research and development details, inventions, account balances, meals, holiday pics and our weddings over the web.
Today, standard security products just donÂ´t match the requirements for a modern online communications system. All existing encoding and authentication systems use public keys from official certification agencies such as Verisign or Cisco.
We need to focus on the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks where the victimsâ€™ identities are at risk of being manipulated during the initial phase of encryption. From the moment users send their encryption key to their trusted user, the information is on the open net/web until it reaches the cloud server. This is exactly the moment when the hacker can access and manipulate the usersâ€™ keys; they basically steal the key usersâ€™ identity as well as their recipientâ€™s.
Over 90% of all companies and users in the world do not realize that they have been hacked, tracked or recorded. This happens regardless of OS, devices, access, content or scenario.
If someone would have asked you ten years ago if you wanted to have a machine that would track your every move and everything you do, would you have said yes? And would you willingly pay for it? Welcome to the smartphone.
Over 90% of all companies will not admit to the fact that they are frequently affected by cyber-attacks because they have a reputation to protect. Yes, it may be that their server is secure, but how secure is their data connection to the server?
Meet the officeKeyâ„¢ team â€“ the pioneers behind iMUNIQE and CTX technology. We all bring unique expertise â€“ from IT development, product design and IT strategy management. What unites us? Quite simply: a desire to help people find a better way to manage their privacy and take control of their content.

What is the Padcaster?
The Padcaster is a versatile iPad case made up of an aluminum frame with a removable urethane insert.  The outside of the sturdy frame is lined with 1/4-20 and 3/8-16 threaded holes for attaching lights, an external mic, or other camera gear. 
With accessories attached you'll probably want to use it on a tripod, shoulder mount or some other support, but the frame is wide and heavy enough - though not too heavy - to stand on its own for shooting or viewing. Plus the size and weight of the frame makes handheld shooting more comfortable, giving you a better, steadier grip.
The secure and flexible urethane insert lets you easily pop your iPad into the Padcasterâ€”a snug fit for protection, confidence and steady shooting on-the-go. 
When youâ€™re done filming with the Padcaster, edit your footage with any of the many great editing and effects apps available on the iPad. Then, upload and share your work with the world. Now you can shoot, edit and distribute your HD video right from the iPad, making it ideal for video blogging, journalism and Livestream.  
Why We Need Your Help
The Original Padcaster is already in production, having been funded almost entirely out of pocket by the Padcaster team, but interest has increased in the past few months and we need help in order to meet the demands of our audience. During the last year, the number one question we've been asked is when we will have a Padcaster for the iPad mini. 
With our limited resources, it would be impossible to continue production of the Original Padcaster while simultaneously researching and developing a Padcaster for the iPad mini, so we need your help!
With this campaign, we hope to fund a second full production run of new and improved Original Padcasters, and successfully manufacture a Padcaster for the iPad Mini, thus giving a wider range of iPad owners the opportunity to take advantage of the all-in-one Production Studio experience!
What Makes The Padcaster Different from the Other iPad Videography Cases Out There?
Though the original inspiration for the Padcaster was as a piece of videography equipment, its versatile design has inspired our customers to use it in a variety of ways we never even imagined.
We've seen our product used as a teleprompter and as a cage for a DSLR. We've seen it tricked out with LED lights, and hooked up to watch television in bed, and in the backseat of a car. We've even seen it used by Kelly Croy of Wired Educator as a tool to help disabled children in the classroom.
Over this last year, we've been amazed to see not only the possibilities of this product, but the inventiveness of the people who use it. We can't help but think that the Padcaster for the iPad mini will inspire more creativity.

Once fully operational Jumbawumba will provide routine third party verification that your searches are safe, secure and Our goal is to listen to our customers and provide the best possible service and performance.
Explanation for the use of the $125k
The $125k we are asking for is to bring the full product to the market. That includes finishing development, hosting, scaling and closing on necessary legal issues. The only feature of the product we may omit in that first phase would be to the metasearch integration.Since Google is over 70% of world search, and that is our primary search engine, we do not see omitting Bing or Yahoo as showstopper for the first release. However should we receive the funds required to integrate that feature we will. Additionally should the funding surpass what is requested we will also employ a marketing strategy that involves national TV advertising. We will communicate the brand and product capabilities every we can.
Risks and challenges
Current Risk Mitigation
There is a live Demo available to see upon request. It displays all the core features. This means there is very little technical risk in completing the product. And since we store no data (photos, video etc) only links we have no significant storage demands.
I have access to developers as well as a development and Go Live start up environment.
I have filed a provisional patent for the product
I have extensive IT Program and Engineering Management experience
Forward Risk
- Scaling for the right amount of users and spare capacity
We intend to deal with this by growing the local or cloud system as the need becomes available. Should the need drive it we will create our own infrastructure. Also - we intend to host outside of the US. (I realize bad people will use my product. Should the US Government, or any other official body, follow proper legal due process we will assist them in their endeavors to find these people. Additionally I will honor the blacklist Google uses to keep people from visiting websites with malware. We will also extend that blacklist for sites the vast majority of society finds objectionable - like child pornography. Basically if you are bad person doing things the most of society would deem objectionable we do not want your business.)
- Some people and businesses may not understand the value of the product or all of the ways they might find it beneficial - We intend to handle this by providing a FAQ with instructions on how to use the site and ideas for people and business to use the automatic search features. We are looking in to having Jumba featured in cartoons to help with this.
- We are dependent on Google and other search engines and the use of their APIs. While we do not anticipate any issues, and see our product as a net positive for Google and others.
With internet and mobile technologies exploding in our lives we never know where our data ends up. There have been numerous articles in the news where hacking leads to personal photos ending up on internet. You hear about sites like revenge porn, where people once trusted post shared photos without their consent for the world to see.
We believe that security should never be an afterthought and you should always own whatâ€™s yours.
So we built SnapOwn, an innovative way to share photos and videos without losing ownership. With SnapOwn, you never lose track of your photos or who is viewing them, itâ€™s secured at all points and you have total control of all your photos, even when shared with friends, family or someone very close.
SnapOwn is a simple to use app that not only makes sharing photos/videos easy but also secure. Its elegant interface ensures ease of use backed by military grade security. With features like Ask-me-first and Let-me-see the sender has complete control over their shared photos and videos.
We have spent over a year perfecting the backbone and the platform of the app and in the process have filed patents for multiple aspects of the app.
We have an alpha version ready for the Android platform and now need your help to build versions for iOS and Windows.

How Does SnapOwn Work?
 Features (Platform)
Features (App)
Security is a primary goal for this platform. We have encryption and security built into every component of the solution.
The database on the phone is encrypted using 256 bit AES
Photos/Videos are encrypted using a unique auto-generated 256 bit AES cipher key, the cipher key itself is secured using 4096 bit RSA keys and the encrypted key is stored away from the device in the SnapOwn cloud. Every photo and video has its own unique key.  
All data exchanged between the phones and the SnapOwn cloud is encrypted using multi layers of 256 bit AES and 4096 bit RSA keys  
What this means is that even if you lose your phone your data is always secured. If someone has both the sender and receiver phones, they still cannot access your data. With the rare possibility that our servers get hacked your data is still secured, thatâ€™s how we have built-in the 3 levels of security right into the core of our platform. To access any data through SnapOwn you need all 3 pieces: sender, receiver and the SnapOwn servers.
This feature allows you to send photos which delete after a specified time; the sender decides what the time should be. Timer based photo exchange helps control how long the receiver can view the photo; once the time is up the photo is deleted from the receiver phone forever.
With Ask Me First you can send photos which require your approval before the receiver can view them. This feature allows you to keep track of who views your photo. If you change your mind later, you may decide to block their access.
Send photos which not only need your approval before being viewed, but also allow you to see what the receiver is doing while looking at your photo. If you change your mind at any point, you can immediately stop him or her from viewing. Let me see brings total control and peace of mind in a world of sharing.
SnapOwn always has you in mind, with features like restrict and un-restrict you are always in control of who can and cannot view photos sent by you. With a few clicks you can restrict any of your contact from viewing all photos ever sent by you. This gives you total control of all photos shared using our platform.

These Sandbox Monthly Services enable you to constantly be in touch with your home, family and friends - and allow you to actually react and respond while a situation is still happening.
While a single camera or a doorbell, or a traditional security service that gives you some door/window and motion sensor could be a good start, Sandbox tightly and affordably integrates and unifies the cameras, doorbell, sensors, instant alerts, smartphone apps, monitoring, cloud recording and location/communication console services!
We designed Sandbox to be the most full featured security available - and we made it extremely attractive, usable and affordable.
Sandbox detects motion or intrusion in your home or at your front door, and instantly alerts you. It enables you and any member of your family to receive alerts and monitor your house from wherever you or they might be. At a restaurant, in the car, at the airport, or even out of town.
Monitor any part of your home. Get text, snapshot or video alerts instantly, wherever you might be.
Set up your relatives, neighbor or best friend to receive Sandbox's instant motion or intrusion alerts or alarms, when you are going on vacation. And check in from that vacation to get a live view of your home
Keep an eye from wherever you might be, on your children, a sick family member, workers in your house, or even your pets..
Never again worry about forgetting to arm the home security system when you leave for work. And forget about having to drive home in the middle of the day to disarm your security system after a plumber, cleaning or delivery service who needs access.
Forward a recorded video of your dog chewing on your sneakers or your neighbor snooping around on your porch, directly from your SandboxCloud storage to all your friends or neighbors!
Record HD photos and videos from your home and front door. View these recorded videos (as well as the messages that your visitors leave on your  doorbell) from anywhere.
Sandbox detects movement or intrusion in your home or at your front door, and instantly alerts you. It enables you, any member of your family, and anyone else whom you authorize, to receive alerts and monitor your house from wherever you or they might be.
The unique Sandbox Smart Doorbell lets you know instantly when someone is at your front door - whether you are in the backyard, at the movies, on a run or hike, or even on vacation. See and hear the visitor. Greet them with a pre-recorded message. Talk with them if you wish. Or let your Sandbox's SmartDoorbell record their video and audio message securely in your SandboxCloud account. All without giving your visitor any idea about where you might be! And you can even put your doorbell on mute when the children (or grown-ups!) in your family are napping.
You can set up and move the Sandbox cameras whenever you want - simply unplug it, move it, and plug it back in - it's just that simple. It powers up from the new location, finds the WiFi signal, and gets back to its business! In fact, you can even move your cameras between homes, between office and home, or even have some cameras in one home while others are in a different home or office - and have them all be part of the same Sandbox system that you receive alerts from, and that you can monitor on your mobile phone from wherever you might be. 
With Sandbox, you have no more old-fashioned security gear, no long term leases or contracts, no hard selling, no drilling holes and pulling wires, no time consuming and complicated installation. No hardcore sales pitches. And you don't have to live with overpriced home security that is limited to door and window tags, a siren, a keypad, and a yard sign!
Get 24/7 monitoring by a team of professional operators as part of the Sandbox Monthly Services. If there is an intruder or an unverified entry into the house, the operators can notify you and others including the police.
We designed Sandbox to be the most full featured security available - and we made it extremely attractive, usable and affordable.
 
Raven Bicycle Registry is a high tech patent-pending bicycle registration and security status system developed over the past year by seasoned product developer Marshall Lind, MBA, who launched the project after being shocked at seeing a cut lock lying where his bike used to be, one of three stolen in less than six months.
The Raven System, designed with engineering, testing and CAD assistance from Jim Pitchford, was created to combat the widely acknowledged bike theft pandemic by integrating owner-managed online bike accounts with remote Smartphone technology.
Raven Registry can immediately establish or securely alter the security status of any registered bicycle with Smartphone activation of uniquely numbered Near Field Communication (NFC) Tags and QR Codes, PERMANENTLY BONDED to the bicycle's frame and incorporated into the bike owner's Smartcard ID.
With this battery-free System and LIFETIME SERVICE, anyone in the world with an Internet-connected Smartphone can determine when a bicycle has been or is being stolen and to whom the bike belongs. All alert pages display the bike's security status, ownerâ€™s first name, last initial and auto-linking phone number for expediting notification.
Proof of ownership can even be determined without Internet service, by comparing the bikeâ€™s QR sticker account number with the one embossed on the bike ownerâ€™s Smartcard ID.
And, because Raven's convenient, easily operated Smartphone system can be used by any bicycle shopper, enforcement officer, and pawn or bike store personnel, Raven Bike Registry promises to have a profound impact on bike larceny and the sale of stolen bicycles.
NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION (NFC)
Although the media touts Near Field Communication(NFC) as an â€œemergingâ€ technology, itâ€™s the offspring of Radio Frequency ID (RFID), a 1960s identification technology. NFC emerged from the 2006 NFC Forum, a consortium of cell phone manufacturers who agreed to develop technologies operating on a standardized broadcasting frequency of 13.56 MHz, requiring close contact signal operation ideally suited for protecting private information and conserving phone power.  
By 2012 major phone brands offered over 85 Smartphones incorporating NFC system hardware and software (itâ€™s not just an App) and the technology standard continues to stimulate NFC application development. 
Raven's NFC Tag 
The NFC tag used in Ravenâ€™s bike emblem and embedded in our Smartcard ID is an ultra-thin target object NFC Smartphones interrogate consisting of:
Â·1) a capacitor for receiving power from an NFC Smartphone,
Â·2) a microchip encoded with a command string, which in Ravenâ€™s case is your bicycleâ€™s unique IP address (account number).
Â·3) an antenna for transmitting this command back through your Smartphone to your bike's online account security status page.
Because the entire Raven Registry system is battery-free, it can detect a â€œStolenâ€ bicycle even years after it disappears, anywhere in the world thereâ€™s an internet connection.
Our first impulse was to hide our NFC tag from thieves, but its antenna is ineffective encased in metal, and there would still be the problem of communicating Raven tagâ€™s existence to the public in a tamper proof manner . 
We ultimately decided the Raven tag should be located openly to serve as both theft deterrent and detector. Raven designed a lightweight (0.10 oz.), tamper-resistant polycarbonate (bullet proof glass) NFC emblem housing conforming to all down-tube sizes that the owner bonds to the bicycle with our permanent 2-part glue.
Even sanding, scarring or painting Ravenâ€™s emblem body fails to impede the NFC tagâ€™s auto-link capability, since line-of-sight readability is not required.
The emblem can withstand multiple direct hammer blows from any angle and any violent attempts to remove it risks damaging the frame, while leaving obvious evidence the bike is stolen. A quick check of the bicycle's Manufacturer Registration number on Raven's Website will immediately reveals the owner's name and phone number.
QR CODE
Because many current Smartphones, including the iPhone series, still lack NFC technology, we've included a QR Code auto-link component in our Raven Registry System. This opens up system interrogation to virtually all Smartphones, since free QR code Apps have been widely available to all Smartphone platforms since 2010.
On the downside, the QR Code is inadequate as a security product by itself, since it relies on line-of-sight readability, which makes it vulnerable to deliberate or accidental defacement or removal. 
Because we have to leave it exposed Raven decided it should be unidentifiable, as a seemingly useless and obscure sticker offering no indication of its security benefits, except to those informed of Ravenâ€™s System.
This durable, high bond, UV protected outdoor vinyl sticker also offers the only visual indicator of the bikeâ€™s unique account number.
WHY NOT GPS?  
INITIAL PURCHASE- 5X the price of Raven's NFC System.
MONTHLY FEE- Phone service charge of $6 to $10.  
LEGAL- Search warrant for one bicycle? Won't happen!
LIABILITY- Bike thief pursuit can lead to injury or death!
RAVEN'S PRODUCTION GOAL
Raven has set its Kickstarter production goal of 5,000 Raven Registry Kits as one large enough to introduce the Raven System in a meaningful way to the cycling community, while allowing us to take advantage of supplier minimums and cost-effective price-points. 
We currently have over 900 uniquely encoded NFC emblems assembled and packaged together with matching QR code stickers and Smartcard IDs, but we need your Kickstarter support to complete our NFC emblem glue kits, since two-part glue burst-packs cost over $1.20 each and our re-packagers in Houston require a 5,000 unit order minimum.
Kickstarter Launch Date
If you plan on being one of the lucky 900 to receive their Bike Registry kits first, donâ€™t delay. Raven is operating in full gear to get the word out on college campuses and to media, bicycle coalitions, clubs, bike stores and event coordinators.
By Late November
By late November Raven will have finalized and beta tested the Raven Bike Registry Website database system, complete with secure password setups, promotional code tables, integrated Paypal registration, and auto-fill and file replacement activation.
By Late December
With a turn-around time for both our glue burst-packs and specialized sticky glue templates of three weeks, including shipping and Registry Kit assembly, 900 early Kickstarter supporters can expect to receive their Raven Registry Kits and other complimentary biking goodies and special invitations in time to secure their new Holiday bike for the New Year.
By Late January
We currently have 5,000 UV-resistant Raven emblem labels and packages in stock, but our ability to order 4,100 of the remaining Registry Kit components hinges upon Kickstarter support. Our polycarbonate emblems can be produced and air-shipped from our Chinese supplier in less than a week, but serial numbered NTAG Smartcards printed by our NFC supplier in Seattle have a turnaround time of 3 weeks. Add another week for QR Code encoding, account setup and Registry Kit assembly here in San Jose.  A successful Kickstarter campaign can get us started early on those kits, so cyclists can receive their Raven Bike Registry kits by late January.
With your support we hope to be working frantically with smiles on our faces all the way through the holidays. 
YOUR RAVEN REGISTRY KIT(s) will include:
1.) A polycarbonate bike emblem with NFC tag shielded by our UV resistant polyester Raven label. 
2.) A QR code UV-resistant outdoor sticker with printed account number. 
3.) An account-matching Smartcard ID with imbedded NFC tag, printed QR code, embossed account number and signature strip. 
4.) An emblem glue kit containing a Glue Guide and Spreader, a glue burst-pack, 60 grit sanding pad and alcohol prep patch. 
5.) Unlimited Raven account service
SETTING UP BIKE ACCOUNTS
After bonding your Raven Bike emblem(s) and QR Code(s) to your bicycle(s) as instructed, return to www.ravenbikeregistry.com to activate your account(s) by either auto-linking via Smartphone through your bike's NFC tag or QR Code or by entering any of your assigned account numbers where indicated on Raven Registryâ€™s home page.
ACTIVATION 
Your e-mail address and a secure password you select will open your dedicated account management page, which lists all uniquely numbered accounts corresponding to the Registry Kit(s) you received. The accounts are only assigned to bicycles once all relevant bike and owner information is provided. A bike owner's name listed under each account may differ from the registrarâ€™s in first name only, allowing family members to register bicycles under a single management account.
The final step involves activating your bikeâ€™s security status alert page to be seen by anyone interrogating the bikeâ€™s Raven emblem or QR Code. The choices are â€œSecureâ€, â€œFor Saleâ€ and â€œStolenâ€, with â€œAccount De-Activatedâ€ available on subsequent account visits when a bike is sold, recycled or given away. Any transfer of a Raven registered bicycle requires a simple secure re-registry to avoid ownership/theft disputes.
Raven will soon have instructional videos on YouTube demonstrating nonthreatening methods for thwarting a bike theft in progress.
In keeping with all great start-ups, Marshall Lind and Jim Pitchford developed, tested and refined the Raven Bike Registry (RBR) status system in a Silicon Valley home office/garage, shared by an Alaskan Malamute and a Chocolate Lab.
Marshall, Raven Protech Inc.â€™s CEO, designed and developed the RBR System and integrated Website design, including graphics interface, user navigation and registration processes at www.ravenbikeregistry.com. He is also directing and coordinating business operations and contract suppliers and is spearheading marketing, PR, sales and special events efforts and initiatives.
Marshall has an MBA and over 20 years of product and service development experience, beginning in 1993 with the design and creation of DESK-DINOS, a dinosaur desk accessory line he manufactured in Shanghai, China and sold to Walmart, Sony and hundreds of retailers nationwide.
In 2000, Marshall shifted to Internet-based marketing projects, most recently serving as Director of Arts In Tulsa for eight years, a member-supported online arts organization he founded to provide electronic media services and support to over 135 artists.
Jim, Raven Protech Inc.â€™s COO, is responsible for decorating the garage floor with polycarbonate emblem housings as he aggressively tested the bonding capabilities of more than a dozen brands of â€œpermanentâ€ glues and VHB tapes on bicycle frames (See Glue Challenge below). He also produced the emblem housingâ€™s CAD design and has provided invaluable consulting assistance at every stage of Raven Registryâ€™s development process.
Jim is a manufacturing process engineer with over 25 years of engineering management, machine programming and part production experience in Silicon Valley with Micro-Mechanics Inc. and IBM. At Raven, Jim will serve as Senior Operations Director, with responsibilities that include working within a flexible production framework initially dependent on building relationships and supervising subcontract production and assembly companies until product demand and economies of scale justify shifting RBR Kit operations in-house.
Gil Garcia is responsible for Raven Registryâ€™s database development, a San Jose State MBA graduate whose stellar programming talent secured contract work at NASA, E-Bay and a number of promising Silicon Valley start-ups.
Our biggest hurtle involved finding a suitable emblem adhesive for bonding polycarbonate to bike frame surfaces while exhibiting the superior peel-away strength required to repel assault.
Jim initially employed his custom-fabricated mechanism to apply and measure the shear and peel strengths of the industrial adhesives and VHB Tapes tested. Once our selection narrowed, he subsequently subjected emblems to methods used by bike thieves, essentially blunt-force trauma with hammer and chisel. Ultimately we selected a clear glue so resilient it literally fuses polycarbonate to the bonding surface. 
Since the two-part glue is permanent, we took special care to simplify the gluing process by including concise instructions and gluing tools in every Raven Registry Kit. Ravenâ€™s â€œBikerâ€™s Snotâ€ glue is packaged in a pre-mix burst pack and our sticky Glue Guide helps pinpoint the exact phone-accessible location on the bikeâ€™s down-tube for the Raven emblem.  
For maximum adhesion, we strongly recommend sanding through the bicycle's clear coat and paint layers using the Glue Guide. This is especially critical on older and/or inexpensive bikes because multiple layers may have been applied improperly or lost their cohesive integrity. Donâ€™t worry, the exposed surface will be completely covered by your Raven emblem. 
The entire gluing process takes less than five minutes and both the glueâ€™s hard, rubber-like consistency and glue guide make clean-up a cinch. Our upcoming online gluing instruction video will fully explain the process.
Initial market feedback suggests our lifetime registry price of $34.95 for Ravenâ€™s sophisticated Smartphone registration and security status system is extremely attractive and conducive to achieving our ultimate objective of saturating bike owner markets to eliminate bike theft.
So Kickstarter supporters get an even better deal!
Our sales model relies primarily on Internet orders, with bike owners driven to Ravenâ€™s Website in a bid to help Raven control bike registration and track sales. We'll also be engaging Bike shops as a valuable resource for promoting the Raven System in ways beneficial to both them and their customers through sales and customer service assistance involving Emblem application and bike owner registration.
Ravenâ€™s marketing and sales efforts will concentrate on college campuses, bike clubs and organizations, ride share and bike rental programs, and bicycle races, rides and events. While much of our initial efforts will focus on after-market bikes, our patent-pending status and strengthening brand recognition will eventually allow us to convince bike manufacturers to integrate the Raven NFC tags into their bike designs. 
Since weâ€™ve already been contacted by a European cyclist racing organization interested in equipping over 2,200 cyclists with the Raven Registry security system, Raven also plans to introduce the Raven Registry System to Europe by next fall. 
In time Ravenâ€™s patent pending Security Status System will protect all of your valuable personal and business property possessions.

Experienced designers, engineers, artists, and entrepreneurs
Tav Shande, Inventor, Founder, & CEO
Fenderhawk was founded by serial entrepreneur Tav Shande in early 2015 after witnessing too many parking hit-and-runs and having multiple experiences with mysterious dents and scratches showing up on his car. The question, "Why aren't cars smart enough to tell you when they've been bumped?" is what shaped the concept of the Fenderhawk camera. For the task of creating the device he recruited the help of the talented John Teel.
John Teel, electronic design engineer, serial entrepreneur
As a former senior design engineer at Texas Instruments (TI) John designed dozens of successful microchips. His designs can be found in all kinds of popular electronic devices including some from Apple and Intel. You almost certainly own several products with TI microchips inside, and most likely a product or two with one of his chip designs.
Previously, John founded a startup called MicroLite Tech. Where he developed and manufactured a low-cost consumer lighting device and brought it to market in over 500 retail locations across three countries. In addition to development he also oversaw manufacturing in Asia, marketing, trade shows, logistics, financing, and sales.
We are growing
In addition to our core team, we are assembling an incredible group of engineers, designers, and industry experts who will be collaborating with us to create the best product possible.
We currently have a working prototype and we're now focused on:
Finalizing the engineering schematics for the final product
Developing and iterating on the user experience for the mobile app
Developing the data visualization tools
Power management and battery placement
We will also begin the process of:
Designing packaging
Product certifictions 
Designing the supply chain process
Materials procurement
Tooling
Production
 What does the functional prototype do?
The current prototype (Not final shape and size) shows what the Fenderhawk camera can do in security mode, taking HD video after sensing an impact and saving the footage. The video is then transferred via Bluetooth. In the four videos below John Teel shows the prototype in action:

Cryptic is a website aimed at providing a secure, private, and safe way to store and share files. With Cryptic you get to control exactly who can see the files you upload; it is impossible for any unauthorized parties to see the things youâ€™ve uploaded because your files are completely encrypted before they ever leave your computer.
Our mission
Our mission is simple - to make cryptographically secure storage easy for everyone.
What separates us from our competitors is our strict adherence to your privacy. Our competitors reserve the right to view and moderate the files you upload, as stated in their user agreements. We at Cryptic do not believe this is acceptable. Files uploaded to Cryptic are yours. We canâ€™t view them, and even though weâ€™re holding onto the encrypted, unreadable copies of your data you still retain full ownership of it.
How Cryptic is different
Current cryptographic tools give people the ability to store their data in an uncompromisable way, so that the file looks like gibberish to anyone but them. But these tools are not user-friendly, and are very discouraging for an average user. Cryptic gives users an easy interface on top of a strong cryptographic base, so that everyone can benefit from encryption. In fact the user doesnâ€™t need to know anything about cryptography to use Cryptic; the interface looks like any other file storage website.
Our simple upload interface
We need your help
Cryptic has the potential to revolutionize the digital storage industry, but we need your help to do it. We need to raise enough money to get us off the ground and create a self-sustaining service. We have a working prototype which features client-side encryption, a simple (but pretty) interface with organizational tools, and secure sharing features. Our service runs on a relatively small server and it works great, but we need more.
The largest percentage of the contributions to this campaign will go towards buying enough server space to host a yearâ€™s worth of data redundantly and towards being able to efficiently serve it out on demand. Weâ€™ve worked out our pricing such that it will cover server rental and bandwidth, but servers also come with an installation cost that we simply cannot bear on our own. The rest of the contributions will go towards creating new features, polishing old features, and feeding us developers.
For our technical readers
When you go to Cryptic all files that you receive will be received over SSL. This is to ensure that youâ€™re getting the correct code, and not a version compromised by some attacker (it can also be verified against an open source repo with a browser extension). When you create an account youâ€™re asked to create a username/password combination, just like any other site. Your browser then generates a public/private encryption key that it will use to sign messages to the server (using randomness from the browser with crypto.getRandomValues). The public key, your username, and a an encrypted "user blob" (we'll get to that in a bit) is sent to our servers. 
When you upload a file, it is split up into chunks, each chunk encrypted (with a unique random long password), and signed inside your browser. These encrypted and signed file chunks are sent to our servers where the signatures are checked against the user's public key (to verify it came from you). The chunk reference name (name the server knows about, also random) and their keys are added to a virtual filesystem in a structure we call the â€œuser blobâ€. The user blob contains your virtual filesystem, your private/public key, and any other personal information. The user blob is encrypted with your hashed password, and signed by your private key and sent to the server as well. As you upload more files, the blob continues to grow. In essence the only data that ever leaves your computer is a public key, a user blob which has been encrypted by your hashed password, and file chunks which have all been encrypted by their own individual keys.
When you wish to share a file with someone else you simply send them a link. The link contains both the filename and the key required to decrypt the file (the key follows a â€˜#â€™ in the url, so it doesnâ€™t get sent to our servers). 
Open-source
We are very passionate about security and we know that many others in the community are too. We also know that security from behind a closed door might as well be no security at all. As such, we pledge that any code we write which touches unencrypted data will be open-source for the world to see. We will also do everything in our power to release the source to all of our other code. You can see what weâ€™ve released so far over at github.com/cryptic-io. You can also expect to see many blog posts from us as we discover better ways to do things and write new libraries to deal with new problems. At Cryptic we think itâ€™s important to give back to the community, not just for the sake of good security but because itâ€™s the right thing to do.
Planned features
Here are some of the features we will work on with the contributions from this campaign:
More sharing options (timed links, passworded links, one-time links)
A stable, public API
A backend system that will store files in triplicate

The three of us are passionate about open-source and making the internet safer for you. Many hours have been poured into Cryptic, and itâ€™s finally time to show it to the world.
Other ways to help
If you can't afford to kickstart Cryptic, that's okay too! We'd love for you to spread the word and raise interest. Post about us on facebook and twitter, and email your friends!
If you don't want to use a credit card you can also send us bitcoins at 14WuoKwQ8tR2vbGq2RbjuCvqGKVSfr5oqy , and if you send us an email at contact at cryptic.io, signed with your address, we will give you the corresponding perks (based on the Mt. Gox price at the time we receive your email).
Quickly, easily, and securely connect your Arduino Unos, Leonardos, Dues, and Megas (and their chipKIT counterparts) to the outside world without having to solder any of those pesky wires!
Even better, in the spirit of the Arduino community, our Proto-Shield will be Open Source! Once this Kickstarter project is completed, we will release the design files for anyone to download under an Open Source license.
What is a Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield?
The great thing about Arduinos is that they are so easy to interface to the outside world â€“ to monitor the state of sensors and to control actuators and make things happen. As part of this, you often need to add a few components or circuits of your own, and the best way to do this is by means of a prototyping (proto) shield. Unfortunately, most proto-shields donâ€™t make it particularly easy to actually connect wires to and from the outside world. The Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino â€“ which works with Uno, Leonardo, Due, and Mega Arduinos (and also their chipKIT counterparts) â€“ addresses this issue by means of its easy-to-use screw-block terminals.
The Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino features two boards as shown below (note that the final boards may be a different color and there may be minor engineering â€œtweaksâ€ and differences to the prototypes shown here).
The Master Board on the left works with Arduino Unos and Leonardos. If you are using a Due or a Mega, you will also require the Expansion Board on the right.
Below we see what a fully-assembled Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master Board will look like with an Arduino Uno (an Arduino is not included with the Proto-Shield system). On the left we see the two boards on their own; on the right we see two views of the Master Shield plugged into the Arduino Uno.
Below we see what a fully-assembled Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master and Expansion Board combo will look like with an Arduino Mega (an Arduino is not included with the Proto-Shield system). At the bottom we see two views of the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master and Expansion Board combo plugged into the Arduino Mega.
How Does it Work?The screw-block terminals featured on the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino make it easy-peasy to connect your Arduino to the outside world.
Of particular interest is the capriciously cunning dual-pad system employed by our Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shields. The few existing screw-block proto-shields that do exist typically have each screw-block terminal directly connected to its associated header pin and a single pad in the prototyping area as illustrated below. The problem is that sometimes you want a screw-block terminal to be connected to its header pin, but sometimes you donâ€™t. For example, you might want to insert some components between the terminal and the header pin. In the case of our Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shields, each screw-block terminal and associated header pin are connected to two separate pads. If you want the terminal to be wired directly to the header pin, you can easily connect the two pads together; otherwise, you can easily connect the pads into the prototyping area.


If you are anything like us, you will have a number of Arduino-based projects on the go at the same time. Depending on your mood, you might start working on one, then swap over to another, and swap back again later. The real hassle comes when you have to unplug lots of external sensors and actuators and other devices. Many people end up purchasing multiple Arduinos to get around this issue.

This is where the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino is worth its weight in gold. If you create each project on its own Proto-Shield, then you can use a single Arduino â€“ all you have to do is quickly and easily swap your Proto-Shields in and out. These shields are also great for educational users â€“ students can implement their projects on their own proto-shields and then share a common Arduino.

The Answer to Your I2C Hassles!
Some shields communicate with the Arduino using the 2-pin I2C interface; the problem is that the various Arduinos use different pins to support the I2C interface. Below we see a typical scenario from one of Max's real-world hobby projects. Max is using a Mega, but the I2C-based LCD display was originally designed for use with an Arduino Uno. The result is that the boards have to be connected using flying leads.

Happily, the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino allows I2C-based Uno shields to work with the other types of Arduino. Below we see the LCD shield on the top, the Ardunio Mega at the bottom, and the Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield Master and Expansion Board combo in the middle. The yellow and green wires connect the Arduino's Mega's I2C pins to their corresponding locations on the Arduino Uno.

Now, using the Arduino-Proto-Shield-LCD sandwich, the LCD shield can be added to the stack without the need for any flying wires as shown below:

The Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System also allows I2C-based Arduino Uno shields to work with Arduino Leonardos and Dues. Donâ€™t worry if any of this is confusing, because the documentation supplied with Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield system will explain everything in excruciating detail.

Our Story
In addition to authoring well-known books on electronics and computing, Max is a renowned EETimes editor specializing in Microcontrollers, Circuit Boards, Programmable Logic, and Prototyping. Duane is the marketing manager and blog author at Screaming Circuits, which specializes in assembling prototype and short-run circuit boards. In their spare time, Max and Duane design and construct all sorts of electronic and computing â€œstuff,â€ from brainwave amplifiers to telepresence robot avatars (be afraid, be very afraid).

One of Maxâ€™s current hobby projects is a Pedagogical and Phantasmagorical Inamorata Prognostication Engine (donâ€™t ask). This little beauty features a cornucopia of antique switches, knobs, dials, and meters, all controlled by an Arduino Mega plus a collection of shields. There were two problems with the original design: existing Mega proto-shields donâ€™t include screw-block terminals and I2C-based Uno shields cannot easily be plugged into a Mega. Max talked to his chum Duane, a robotics expert who designs his own circuit boards. Between them, Max and Duane came up with the galaxyâ€™s most Universal Proto-Shield System â€“ anyone working with an Arduino (or a chipKIT equivalent) needs one of these little beauties.

The Rewards
If you are feeling adventurous, you can simply purchase a bare (unpopulated) Master Board or Master-Expansion Board combo, and then source the other components â€“ headers, screw terminal blocks, and reset switch â€“ yourself (we'll provide details as to these components and some suppliers in the documentation accompanying the boards). Alternatively, you can purchase complete kits that include all of the components.

Of course, you'll still need solder and a soldering iron but we'll talk about these in the instructions, and we'll also point you towards some online soldering tutorials if you need them.

In addition to detailing how to assemble the boards, the documentation accompanying your Universal Screw-Block Proto-Shield System for Arduino will also cover how to use them to make I2C-based shields designed for use with Arduino Unos work with Arduino Leonardos, Dues, and Megas (and their chipKIT equivalents). 

Production plan (or "How we learned to stop worrying and love the board"). The Internet doesn't have a "do what I'm thinking button" yet, so we had to actually plan this out.
Step 1: The idea
Completed, otherwise we wouldn't be here.
Step 2: Design the first prototype
Completed. In fact, we've made, ordered, received, and are currently using three revisions of the design already.
Step 3: Complete the Kickstarter application
Completed. The Kickstarter process is well thought out and educational.  It does a great job of getting everything in focus before a project is launched.
Step 4: Find sources and quote the materials
Completed. We have two options for sourcing the PCBs (and others as backups). Also, all of the components have been quoted in multiple different quantity levels.
Step 5: The Kickstarter campaign itself
In progress. Assuming a start date of 3/27/14, and running for 30 days, the campaign will end 4/26/14.
Step 6: Ordering the materials
Depending on the end volume, PCBs will be ordered on either a three or a four week lead time. That can be a painfully long time to wait, but it's what makes this project affordable.
The components are coming from three different suppliers. They'll arrive about three weeks after placing the orders.
Other supplies (e.g., mailing envelopes, shipping labels, parts bags) will, again, be ordered from multiple suppliers. Shipping lead times on these items will vary from one to three weeks.
All of the orders will be placed immediately at the end of the campaign. We anticipate being in possession of all of the items toward the end of May.
Step 7: Fulfilling the Early Bird awards
The Early Bird awards are PC boards only. The boards are dependent upon fewer suppliers, which will make fulfillment quicker. We'll ship the 100 Early Birds as soon as we receive the boards, so they should be winging their way before the end of May.

Step 8: Fulfilling the remaining awards
We will package and ship these immediately following the Early Birds. Depending on the final volume, this could take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

We anticipate that all of the rewards, except the Monty awards, will be fulfilled during the month of June. We will start fulfilling the Monty awards immediately following fulfillment of the Early Bird, Snoozy Bird, and Whole Shebang awards.
Why build email for kids?
Our kids are growing up with technology all around them. We're building Cubtab to help introduce our kids to the online world in a way that's fun, engaging, and safe. 
Gmail, Yahoo, and other email services are great for grown upsâ€”but they don't work for kids. Not only are they stacked full of advertisements, but they are designed for adults, and kids don't find them fun. But even more importantly, they don't provide parents with the tools they need to ensure their children are safe.
What's the solution?
Cubtab is specifically designed for kids. We're stripping out everything that makes email complex, and creating a fun and engaging experience for children. With Cubtab, kids can create messages that include drawings, stickers, and audio messages.
We're also building a moderation app that allows parents to monitor and control what their child sees. With the moderation app, parents can quickly approve or reject incoming and outgoing messages from their iPhone or the web.
The Cubtab Email App
We're building Cubtab for iPad and the web. There's virtually no learning curve and kids love using it. Messages are grouped by contact which makes it easy to keep track of conversations.
Children will love being able to add drawings to their messages. This is especially nice for younger kids who aren't yet able to write, but want to send a message to Grandma or another family member.
Kids can also record and attach audio to a message. Want to make Grandma's day? Attach both a drawing and an audio recording!
Kids love stickers, and including them in their messages and drawings will be a cinch. We're designing a fun set of stickers that your children can use to enhance their messages.
Want to help design a custom sticker? Make sure to check out our $100 pledge level.
The Moderation App
We're creating a tool for parents that makes it easy to keep track of Cubtab activity. Parents can moderate messages from their iPhone or the web. You decide what content is appropriate for your child.
By default, contacts will be on the "Yellow List" and will require moderation before the message is sent or received.
Trusted contacts can be "Green Listed" to forego the need for moderation, which allows messages to be sent freely back and forth.
"Red Listed" contacts cannot send or receive messages to/from your child.
At any time a parent can view all Cubtab activity, such as: sent/received messages, contacts added, child logins, and more.
Why Kickstarter?
Our goals with Kickstarter are two-fold:
1. We want to get Cubtab into the hands of our supporters so we can get real-world feedback before we open up to a wider audience. When you become a supporter, you will get access to our private pre-release where you can reserve your children's email address and start using the app before we open it up to the masses.
2. There are several costs associated with opening Cubtab up to the general public. The money you give will help us get things up and running in a more timely manner.
With your support, Cubtab will be up and running in no-time!
Who are you guys?
Rewards
Most people have something on their phone they don't want anyone to see.  If you use the built-in security lock that comes with your smartphone, you're in trouble. Directions to crack these locks are all over the internet. It only takes one persistent significant other or thief with infrared to get in quickly.
BioTect-ID is a revolutionary, twice-patented way to lock down your entire mobile or just sensitive apps with biometric assurance. Biometrics are the strongest identification technology on the planet.
BUT unchanging physical biometrics like iris, face scan or fingerprints can be hacked.  Lose them, and you're toast.
BioTect-ID is a password you draw with your finger.  It's a gesture biometric, dynamic and replaceable anytime.There's no risk of losing body part data.
â€¢ BioTect-ID learns your unique way of drawing while you create a four character password with your finger
â€¢ Nobody draws just like you. Even if a hacker literally had a screenshot of your password and traced it, BioTect-ID will still know it's not you.
â€¢ How? Because it's measuring HOW you write - angle, speed, length, width and other secret sauce metrics
â€¢ To unlock your phone or app, just draw your new password into the prompt panel.
Here's the process with our existing technology BioSig-ID. The end app will look cooler.
Here we're locked a tablet in landscape mode (also works portrait). First, tap your screen to wake it.
 Enter your password with your finger.
 Then tap the unlock button.
Your password is compared to your profile and if it matches, access is granted. Takes about 3 seconds to unlock. (The same as built-in locks.)
Easy enough but there's a ton of science behind it.
"Biometrics are the ONLY way to recognize you as you" --Department of Defense website
Quick comparison with Android's connect-the-dots and iOS's numeric tap locks:
With BioTect-ID hackers have two major hurdles to overcome.  It gives you Two-Factor authentication, but without the annoying SMS or fob like other Two-Factors.
Someone who wants in has to:
1. Discover your password
2. Fake your biometric drawing style, which is all but impossible.
This never-seen-before combination of a biometric PLUS a knowledge barrier gives you incredible biometric security with no down side.
What's most amazing is that we made a replaceable biometric! No physical biometric can ever be replaced. With BioTect-ID, reset your password any time.
Did we mention it's fun? We polled users:
Everybody always wonders if they must be precise. NOPE.
In a nutshell,
â€¢ BioTect-ID doesnâ€™t rely on something unchanging about you so it's much safer
â€¢ It's a behavior that can be easily replaced or revised - again, no other biometric resets!
â€¢ It's dynamic so your gesture can't be stolen, lost or borrowed
â€¢ Is not ad-supported or requires further buys
â€¢ Gesture biometrics are just as distinguishing as static body parts but non-invasive - requires no personal body info that violates your privacy or puts you at risk of losing key information
How accurate? Testing proves we exceed National Institute of Standards for Technology biometric standards by a whopping 300%!
We'll incorporate our patented drawing pad here:
The BioTect-ID Interface
Into an app that will look like this. You can use it in portrait or landscape mode.
Choose anything for your characters. Not just numbers or letters. Symbols too. Use as many as you want. 4 is the minimum.
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT
BioTect-ID provides incredibly strong Multi-Factor authentication, AKA Two-Factor authentication, which is SO strong that very few people have figured out how to implement it cheaply and without hardware.
We do not know of another multi-factor security app out there WITHOUT one-time passwords, texts, random codes and other nonsense.
They are not biometrics either.
BioTect-ID is powered by our patented biometric software BioSig-IDâ„¢.
Sign up process takes about 2 minutes.
Third Party Testing Accuracy Rate:
No one beat BioTect-ID in tests; the Tolly Group rated accuracy at a statistically valid 99.97% using the Rule of Three (using the three people who got closest).
This blew away the biometric standards for accuracy set by the National Institute of Standards for Technology (NIST). We exceeded them by 300%!
More Cool Features
BioTect-ID will remember unique sequences in how you draw.  It recognizes these as part of the password itself!
Draw backwards
Draw in random order
Use invisible ink for shoulder surfers
You can even draw all the characters on top of each other like this:
BioTect-ID is configurable. Use it for your main screen security, as a secondary layer, or to secure specific apps.
Pricing
We gave a lot of thought to our pricing. We all like free or $1.99. Many apps are cheaper but...you get what you pay for. We do not want to give our customers an annoying, ad-supported app or require more purchases for more utility like other apps. BioTect-ID is more like buying security software than an app. It's a completely unique technology and a premium solution.
Who's Noticed Us
The White House chose us from a field of 180 companies to participate in a NSTIC pilot program to prevent identity theft and begin the process of doing away with the (old) password.
Weâ€™ve also been named to the NASPO (North American Security Products Organization) committee to develop ANSI standards for Identity Proving and Verification.
Why We Need Your Help
Like most young companies itâ€™s hard to fund new technology. We may be small, but we dream big. This will be our first time to create an app for people, not companies, and introduce everyone to this game-changing biometric technology.
To build the BioTect-ID app weâ€™ll use BioSig-IDâ„¢. Good news: the invention already exists. Challenge: itâ€™s very expensive to program an app.
About Our Team
"The technology behind BioTect-ID goes back to 2004, when my wife Cindy and I came up with the idea for a hand-drawn password biometric. BioSig-ID was issued two patents, in 2007 and 2011.
Our company Biometric Signature ID began licensing BioSig-ID technology in 2012.  The first converts were in Higher Education which is using it to authenticate online students, preventing fraud and academic dishonesty.
The invention came from an idea I had while working at a company that made electronic prescription software.
I had one of those epiphany moments....thinking about ways to establish the identity of physicians when they prescribed controlled substances. We had just pitched the DEA, which wanted a method to do that. I started thinking about a software-only, gesture biometric for identity authentication. I looked at my CTO, he looked at me and we raced back to the office to start working on the concept. It was intense...during development, he actually moved into our house.
Here's Cindy and me at a conference, out spreading the word:
Cindy and Jeff Maynard
We've been selling to business. Now we want to make privacy friendly, biometric security available to everyone. We're passionate about the technology and want to make mobile devices and the internet a safer place.
In a few years biometrics will be a fact of life. All security experts agree we will become a biometrically identified society. The time to think about protecting your physical data is NOW. The time for new technologies is NOW before invasive ones are entrenched.
It's VHS vs. Betamax. Bluray vs DVD.
If you love privacy...
Supporting our technology supports a less invasive, just-as-secure method of identification.
One that doesn't need to keep a copy of your body parts. Why let others copy and keep a part of you? With our game changing biometric, there's no need!
We are a legitimate alternative to body biometrics.
If you think recovering from ID theft is hard now, try it when someone has stolen your body information.
The last privacy frontier is the human body. Please help us get this technology out. We hope with enough support, we might just change the future."
-Jeff Maynard

  More Info on The Critical Importance of Multi-Factor
BioTect-ID is a multi-factor authentication technology, which is the most secure form of identification possible. In 2014, the White House called for a switch to multi-factor authentication and away from passwords, pins, security questions and layered solutions in cyberspace. Multi-factor authentication requires any two of these three things:
â€¢ Something you are (biometric)
â€¢ Something you know (password, security questions, personal info)
â€¢ Something you have (fob, drive, mobile)
Other biometrics arenâ€™t multi-factor authentication. They are only one step in the chain!
YES BioTect-ID provides all-in-one multi-factor authentication, the strongest method that exists. It's something you are and something you know. With BioTect-ID, state of the art security is available to anyone.
There is nothing like BioTect-ID anywhere. It solves the double-edged sword of biometrics:
Physical data provides the highest certainty in identity authentication but the most risk as it can never be replaced.
The worldâ€™s first proactive personal safety system allows anyone to quickly and easily create an information trail and follow-up mechanism to be stored on the cloud.  Create your event calendar using any Smartphone, Tablet, or PC, then let the PS Secure application and our Kwik-Send Technology do all the work! Because your safety demands more than an app!
In an increasingly dangerous world mankind is using technology to solve every imaginable problem and streamline every process. But until now, the world hasn't truly utilized technology to solve the problems associated with personal safety. Isn't it time someone did? 
At Project Safety, we are that someone! Weâ€™re technology professionals, developers, businessmen, and law enforcement professionals building a solution to the personal safety concerns of the 21st century. We've studied every possible scenario of life in and out of the home and office, and have developed a means for mitigating risk at every level, compiling these functions into one cloud-based system that covers all the bases.
For years now we've been taking notes on the needs of the general public and have spent thousands of hours developing and testing this needed technology. We've seen the abductions, disappearances and accidents, and have worked hard to see that the latest technologies are utilized to mitigate the circumstances of these events.
Other personal safety apps are just that... an app! They're no more than glorified panic buttons that won't work in the face of true danger! If you were to encounter a sudden accident or were to get abducted, you won't have time to activate a simple app. And if you did, how useful could it be when a predator separates you from your device?
We've employed a network of off-device storage systems and coupled them with the latest compression technologies to fully utilize cellular and wireless technologies in a way that can make a difference for you! We've fully developed our system to work with Android and Apple iOS devices, and have been testing these systems for months now with plans to launch to the public following this campaign! In the future we plan to develop this technology for Windows Mobile and RIM so that everyone can feel the security our system offers... but we need your help to complete our mission in a time frame that makes sense. After all, "We have lives to save!"
What makes the PS Secure Mobile application and the SAND system so unique? Our Kwik-Send Technology coupled with our mobile device technology ensures your safety by sending data off-device instantly to be safely stored on the cloud to protect data important to your safety.

That mobile app allows you to receive reminders from the system when your set event notification time draws near.  Once you enter the proper pin twice, your event is closed.  If you fail to respond, the calling process begins and your Security Contacts will be contacted.

Another great feature is that everything can be done from your Smartphone or tablet.  Events can be created, edited, and referred to right through your device.  If the mobile application isn't working, or you've not had time to download it to your device yet, you can simply access your account through our web site.  And since our site is reactive, it scales to your mobile device, making it easy to access data stored in the Journal, and allows you to make changes to your profile.
When you access the Project Safety web site from your mobile device, you can see all of your open and closed events, and access all data associated with your current or previous events.  Your dashboard is available to you from anywhere, from any device, as long as you have an Internet connection!
Our event function can be utilize as extra protection for every imaginable event in or out of your home and office.  For one-on-one and group meetings, for trips to the gym and jogs in the park, and for any job that requires working in the field.  
Each step of the data entry process is sent off-device instantly, starting with setting a Notification Time and Date.  You set this time and date for sometime after you expect your event to conclude so the system knows when to check on you.  If your event runs late, you can use the edit function to change the time the system will check on you, or add more data or images.
The second step allows you to name your event and add data.  For a date this might be "Dinner and a Movie with Joe."  For a Real Estate agent its likely best to use the address of the property showing, like "1220 Sycamore Street". For a party or outing you might name the event "Party at Billy Joe Sims House."  For the data field you'll want to enter as much or as little as you like, keeping in mind that this data might become important if something happens.  You'll want to include the name of your date and his cell phone number, and the location of the movie theater you're planning to go to, as well as the what movie you'll be seeing.  If dinner follows, describe the restaurant and its location.  Remember, this data can also be updated using the edit function.  Again, as soon as you enter this information, it leaves your mobile device instantly to be stored on our network of cloud storage servers.
The 3rd and final step of the process, you can chose to snap a photo.  If you choose no, the event creation process is complete and the system is set to check on you when the time you set matures.  If you chose yes, the camera will appear so you can snap a photo.  Once you snap a photo, it will be sent back to our system immediately and stored with your event.  Next, you will be asked if you'd like to take another photo, and the process begins again.  You can take as many as 3 photos for any event.
Now the event entry process is complete!  Here's how the system might be used by a Real Estate agent...
Our system is so versatile that you can utilize our application on any tablet or Smartphone. But the PS Secure application can also be used with the SAND system's Kwik-Send Technology to send data to the cloud for storage of meeting notes, auto accident images, and images and data that are associated with an event you witnessed or simply thought was peculiar. This can be done using the Journal function. And since the Journal function doesn't require the entry of a notification time and date, it acts as your own personal cloud storage resource! Everything you enter leaves your device within a few seconds... even high resolution images!
When you're traveling, or have family members traveling, you'll want to make sure you have all the best safety measures in place.  At Project Safety we have your back in the most high-tech of ways with our Travel Event function.
The Travel Event function works much the same as the Event function, as you would set a Notification Time and Date, set a name for your Travel Event, and then enter information on your travel plans.  If you were going to Pensacola, Florida from Austin, Texas (as we did in the next video), you'd set your time for the next day when you expect to arrive.  In a long trip travel situation, you may want to set a time that allows you a couple of extra hours for arrival.  But if not, you can use the edit function to extend your Notification time.
Once you set your time, you'll name your event and enter data. If you're going to Pensacola, you may want to name your Travel Event "Pensacola."  When entering data in the data field, you'll want to enter the route you plan to take, and if possible, where you plan to stop for fuel and food.  This is where the GPS Tag function can come in handy.  By touching the GPS Tag button every time you stop, whether it's for gas, food, or even auto trouble, you are marking your GPS location instantly and automatically adding a time stamp.  Should you not reach your destination, family and law enforcement will have the GPS locations you tagged to start an investigation.  This is a great tool for traveling students going away to school.
The GPS Tag function is a great tool that has many uses. When you have events created for your calendar and you touch the GPS Tag button, that tag is linked to the most recent event on your calendar, because it's the event most likely to be in play at that time.  When the system calls to check on you, if you fail to enter the correct pin, or any pin at all, the system will begin calling your security contacts.  When your security contacts receive the email and text with the link to the event data, they'll see the GPS location you tagged, and all the other data associated with the event.
Remember, the GPS Tag can be used for marking your location if you feel a lack of security in your surroundings, or if your travel plans are altered without the opportunity to use the edit function to edit your event.  For delivery drivers, outside sales associates, truck drivers, real estate agents, and all other positions that require working in the field, GPS Tag can be great for marking your route for your records or your company records, or simply as proof of where you've been.
One of the most useful and important functions of our system and mobile application is the edit function.  This function allows you to edit any event in your calendar from anywhere using the PS Secure mobile application on your Smartphone or tablet, or you can do this on your PC!
The edit function allows you to change or extend your notification time and date, add or change the information for your event, and add images at any time.
Here are additional highlights of our system, designed to address these safety concerns:
Because of Smartphones, Cell Phones, Tablets, and PCs, we all have a way to utilize the proactive power of the Project Safety Smart Automated Notification and Deterrent (SAND) system. In a minuteâ€™s time you can easily leave an information trail through the Project Safety web site or mobile application.
Through the use of 3G and 4G networks, high speed Wi-Fi connectivity, and the latest image compression technologies, data can be moved off-device instantly to insure data integrity, and to prevent a predator from destroying an information trail that could turn out to be life-saving evidence. Through the use of GPS functions such as our GPS Tag, you can mark your location in a single touch when traveling or in danger.
Because weâ€™ve developed an easy to use mobile application to connect to our system software, you can leave an information trail and follow-up mechanism from anywhere you have an Internet connection. Each step of data entry leaves your mobile device instantly using our Kwik-Send technology. For sales professionals, truck drivers, and delivery persons on the go, we've incorporated a mobile edit function for those appointment schedules that change throughout the day.  With this edit function real estate agents and other professionals can change the notification time, and add images and data to their calendar in a instant from their mobile device.
While entering data for events such as a date or individual meeting, the final step allows you to take pictures that leave the device within 3 seconds of taking the shot, preventing anyone from stopping the process. And because the Notification Time is entered first, the follow-up mechanism was activated the moment the process began. A voice and audio record function that streams the audio to a secure cloud location can be useful in many ways,and will be incorporated in the near future.
In order to meet your needs and needs of every possible member and their social networks, Project Safety is designed to be versatile. Teens, college students, parents, real estate agents, business professionals, and anyone can use the SAND system and the PS Secure mobile app for an added feeling of security. The Journal function, which does not require a follow-up mechanism, can be used to store images and data such as diary entries, business information, and accident images and data; all to be stored on the cloud instantly for future use. It's fast, easy, and secure!
In order to maintain your privacy, when you become a member, the signup and setup processes are simple and donâ€™t require an address, birth date, license number, or social security number. You decide how you will use the system, what data is to be entered, how much data is to be entered, and who is to be contacted in the case of an emergency. The only time data will be released is in the case of an emergency, and only to the Security Contacts chosen by you.   We are not a government entity, nor are we associated with a government entity, and will not allow access to your data by any entity or organization outside of our company.  Your chosen security contacts decide what action is to be taken, and who is to take that action. This more personal approach insures quick action and lends a personal perspective to emergency situations in the case of making important decisions, and to support any necessary investigations. 
PS Secure will be available to everyone at a very affordable price and has many uses such as tracking travel progress, and marking locations instantly for the lone traveler. And the Emergency function allows you to snap a picture that leaves the device instantly using our Kwik-Send technology, and marks your GPS location while automatically activating the notification process. Medical information can also be stored and released by the member quickly and easily in the case of an injury or accident. In the case of software licensing by companies and organizations, administrative functions such as mass broadcasting will be available to notify members of company-wide meetings, weather alerts, and sudden situations of danger.
Because time is of the essence in preventing a personal crime and saving a life, our automated notification function is unique to our system. Itâ€™s fully automated, and checks on you through the mobile app if you fail to check in. If the proper response is not confirmed, the system will immediately begin calling the designated Security Contacts you chose.  When your chosen Security Contact receives the call and confirms receipt by pressing 1, the system instantly sends the contact an email and text message containing a link to your event data, images and GPS location. No other system offers this instant off-device storage and delivery technology! 
Through our free email newsletter â€œThe Safety Netâ€, weâ€™ll share such useful information as safety news stories, safety recalls, growing concerns of safety for families, businesses, and individuals, and evaluations of the latest safety devices and technologies.
Everyone!  We simply don't know what we will encounter each day when we leave our homes for work, vacation, or simple daily tasks.
But we do know that fast action, fast communication, and a proactive approach is the key to protection, and that compiling these factors with usable GPS functions and data protection, we can save lives. Now anyone can cover the bases in seconds. The key to success is developing a system that is proactive, and that stores your data instantly off-device with an automated follow-up function and delivery system to ensure your safety. We call this system the Smart Automated Notification and Deterrent (SAND) system. Anyone with an Apple or Android smartphone, tablet, or any PC can utilize our system for proactive protection. Eventually, weâ€™ll be on all platforms, including Windows Mobile and RIM (Blackberry) operating systems, making our system available to everyone.
There are plenty of simple reactive mobile apps available that will call 911 or a call center. But if you are attacked or in a sudden accident,you won't have time to activate these apps. When it comes to your safety, only a truly proactive system can give you real protection.  Click here to see our site.
The potential of our project shows through the people dedicated to Project Safety.  These members have made significant contributions to see that Project Safety meets its goals of saving lives and making the world a safer place through the use of our unparalleled technology and PS Secure mobile application. Here are a few of the dedicated individuals currently contributing to the project:

Record into Mac and PC computers using Garage Band, Audacity, or other recording software.
RECAP USB
Some background
I'm an electronics engineer and the creator of the RECAP audio adapters. RECAP products are focus on getting people's phone calls recorded directly into another device. Our product line allows recording to devices such as PCs, voice recorder, iPod, iPad, tablet and Mac laptops. 
I have previously funded RECAP model S2 in Kickstarter. This model outputs audio in a stereo microphone port found in most PCs and digital voice recorders. This project is complete. All units were delivered to backers and it is now available for sale at RecapMyCalls.com
I have also funded in Kickstarter RECAP Model C. This model outputs audio in a combo port format. This project is also complete and all units delivered to backers.  Product is now for sale at RecapMyCalls.com
RECAP USB 
After launching these two products and I learned a lot about user's needs. Many users wanted to record calls into their Mac computers. However, many Macs do not have a combo or mic port, so RECAP S2 and C would not work right out-of-the-box in those systems. 
That is why I came up with a RECAP USB, the RECAP for Mac users. (it also works with Windows PCs). Now Mac uses have sure easy to use solution for recording without require additional adapters.
Diagram showing how to connect RECAP USB
How does RECAP USB works?
When you connect RECAP USB to your computer, your computer will automatically detect it as a new audio input source.  You should then select it as your audio input.
RECAP USB shows as new input source
Once you've done that, your're ready to record the calls. Just hit the record button in your favorite recording software. I recommend Audacity. It's a free & powerful software for recording.

Production Plan
If the Kickstarter is funded, I'll create a revised version of the circuit board to fix some minor issues, such as component footprint. I'll then make a small batch of boards (hand assembled) so they can be fully tested before the go ahead for mass production. Then finally I'll send the design files to my manufacturer in China and we'll collaborate on the manufacturing details. 
The manufacturer will mass produce the circuit boards and mount all the components with automated processed. The finished boards will then be shipped to the US, where I'll coordinate their assembly into the enclosures, packing and shipping. All from Minnesota!
Enclosures will be manufactured using 3D printing technology. Material is ABS (Lego-like material) with Z resolution of 0.25mm or better.
Manufacturing RECAP enclosures. (model C shown)
 Alternate plan: I'll investigate two alternate processes for enclosure manufacturing. One is injection molding and another is SLS 3D printing. If price, volume and timing look good I'll move enclosures to one of those alternate solutions. 
Become a Reseller
We are currently looking for resellers to distribute our product around the world. If you would like to discuss becoming a reseller and getting a batch of RECAP at a wholesale price please contact us here
Important: check your local law to ensure you are complying with the applicable laws pertaining to phone call recording, copying of audio files and however you plan to use RECAP.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
Project Sierra is a global network with a consumer grade, Android based, plug & play network device that will enable you to use the internet anonymously and encrypt all of your network traffic.Encrypting all of your network traffic is central to the functionality of Project Sierra to avoid having your online activities tracked and recorded. Project Sierra will add an extra level of security without making any changes to your computer or network configuration. I decided to launch this project because I am irritated with how everything I do online is being recorded. Also, I want to enable people without a technical background access to the connected world without fear of anyone recording or spying on their daily activities.
Over the years I have seen technology become easier to use and as a result:
â€¢ Anyone can track your online activitiesâ€™ and store this information.
â€¢ Companies are selling your personal information without your knowledge.
â€¢ Bandwidth is being throttled for certain internet and video protocols.
â€¢ There is a limit to accessing  information depending on the country where you live.
Why is this important?
Growing up with the internet I have seen technology change for the better. It has allowed us to exchange ideas, reconnect with lost friends, manage our lives, cut the cost of doing business, and we have multiple forms of entertainment at our fingertips. But, with the ease of use of technology and the â€œalways onâ€ internet connection the vast majority of users are completely exposed. For example, webcams, smart phones, and tablets are broadcasting everything the user is doing without their knowledge. Here is a link to a Forbes article that outlines the issue in greater detail. (http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/05/the-crazy-things-a-savvy-shodan-searcher-can-find-exposed-on-the-internet/) Currently, tech-savvy individuals are the majority of internet users that have the understanding required to protect themselves from being exposed online. The primary goal of Project Sierra is to provide an added layer of security for the average user.
 Here is where the money will be used.
â€¢ Circuit simulations and Analysis, Schematic, PCB Layout, Component Engineering, and Power Supply.
â€¢ Software/Firmware Programming and Debugging.
â€¢ Website and Database Development.
â€¢ Mechanical Concept Drawings, Industrial Concept Drawings, Photo-realistic Renderings, Aesthetic Design, Stress Thermal and Structural Analysis, and Documentation.
I have been working on the hardware and software for over a year and it is currently being tested, debugged and improved for ease of use. Powering Project Sierra will be a global network which users will access using the touch screen encryption device. The network is based on HTTPS making the traffic identical to standard HTTPS websites like your bank or email account, which will be very difficult to spy on or throttle users of Project Sierra. Also, users will be able to choose the country where the traffic/connection is established, allowing you to bypass geographic restrictions and protect your location.
Sierra Network Overview 1
This diagram illustrates how the encryption device will gain access to the Project Sierra network.
Step 1: The user will sign up for an account at the point of sales website.
Step 2: The encryption device will retrieve a list of active security servers from the Data base server.
Step 3: The encryption device establishes an encrypted connection with the security server. 
Sierra Network Overview 2
This diagram illustrates how the userâ€™s devices will access the internet as demonstrated in the proof of concept video.
The Working Prototype Design
Here are images of the prototype I had to bootstrap together with an ordinary 7" android tablet for the user interface and a reprogrammed consumer grade router to create the encryption device.
User Interface
This is the dashboard where the main features will be accessed by the user. The intent of this design is to keep the use of the encryption device as simple as possible.
The ability to choose which geographical location the user wishes to terminate into the internet will be the focus of Project Sierra.
Once the user establishes an active encrypted connection the background will change to green.
Early Hardware Design
Here is the initial design with a non-touch enabled display one outside interface, one inside interface, and a crypto ignition key (CIK).
Hardware Design
This diagram illustrates the core design of the encryption device and is not final. In this core design the touch screen was added and the CIK was removed. The CIK was removed to cut the cost of production and will be added in the later version of the encryption device. Also, four internal ports were added for an expanded local wired network. The final specs for the encryption device are:
- Wireless 802.11n
- 10/100 RJ-45 x5
- LED Link Lights x8
- Power Jack 12VDC --- 0.5A
- 7â€ Color LCD Touch Screen
Preliminary Design
Here is an early look at the concept design for the encryption device.
Firmware Design
This diagram illustrates the basic layout of the user interface.
The Impact
Project Sierra will change the way we use internet by giving average users the ability to change their location and IP addresses with the click of a button. All of the usersâ€™ identifying information being broadcasted and recoded across the internet will become useless. Most cyber-attacks are directed at a userâ€™s known IP address. When you create a connection between your computer and our servers, your home network is given a layer of security you do not currently have. Your computer, connected devices, programs and applications will be encrypted. Your information will not be seen, only the Project Sierra server IP will be visible to the world. Currently, there is no alternative to the Project Sierra, but with your support we can make Project Sierra a reality to secure our internet.
Who am I?
My name is Kerry C. Cox, Jr. and I am the founder of Simplified Network Solutions, LLC and the Lead Designer of Project Sierra. My combined experience comes from more than 10 years serving in the U.S. Army, working for Fortune 500 companies, and U.S government institutions. I have been involved in designing, deploying, and managing mission critical systems and networks. My love for computers and curiosity of how they work has inspired me to create Project Sierra in order to protect oneâ€™s identity and location online. My ultimate goal with this project is to provide the average person with the comfort of security.
Cost to the user
Once your free trial period has expired you will be able to have continued access to the Sierra network at the Kickstarter Exclusive rate of $9.99/month. There will be no caps on bandwidth or data usage. Also, you will be grandfathered in at this price as token of my appreciation for your early support.

LifeStyleLock zero5
Secured and within arms reach
Each of us has something to protect. Whether its prescription medications, valuables, a firearm, identity related documents, or simple privacy, we all need a secure, accessible space that we can quickly and naturally access.  
The zero5 enables security that tightly integrates with the way you live your life. Items that are most valuable to you, and those that are most urgently needed, are now secured within arms reach in your nightstand, dresser or desk.
Advanced smartphone control, coupled with secure Bluetooth communications and proprietary sensor technology, ensure youâ€™re aware of the status of those items that are most important to you and your family.
Designed around you, and your internal home security needs
Traditional safes and lockboxes are unsightly and unsophisticated. As consumers we either elect not to buy them, or we hide them in our closet or basement - which impedes access and limits use.
Just how effective is a safe or lockbox if it isnâ€™t actively being used?
The zero5 attaches to your existing nightstand, dresser or desk in just 15 minutes. The front and side appearance of your furniture is unchanged. Everything you place in the drawer (jewelry, cash, a firearm, prescription medications, identification) is suddenly secure.
zero5 installed on a 28" nightstand (illustration)
Though compact, the zero5 proprietary lock provides overwhelming holding force. If someone attempts to breach the drawer, theyâ€™ll quickly discover thereâ€™s no hope. More importantly, your zero5 will immediately notify you of this unauthorized attempted breach.
Overbuilt to inspire confidence
The proprietary hardened-steel lock is compact, industrial-grade, and rated at over 100,000 cycles - or more than 20 years of typical use. The zero5 housing is comprised of glass-reinforced nylon and designed specifically to withstand multiple hammer strikes. The battery backup is designed for extended (up to 60 day) on-battery life. Indeed every component of the zero5 is built to last.
The zero5 is controlled exclusively by your smartphone and the intuitive zero5 app. After a few interactions your zero5 will become an integral part of your lifestyle.
Youâ€™ll soon discover that you use your zero5 routinely, dramatically improving your security, and that of your family.
zero5 app
"Security Awareness" is critical
A home security alarm doesnâ€™t improve the impenetrability of your home, and yet you feel substantially more secure with the alarm in place. Thatâ€™s the power of â€œsecurity awarenessâ€.
The Bluetooth-equipped zero5 leverages advanced onboard sensors to provide its owner with a high degree of security awareness.
TamperSenseTM
TamperSense leverages an onboard three-axis accelerometer to monitor the secured furniture. If there is an attempted breach, TamperSense alerts the owner immediately.
LockQueryTM
LockQuery leverages optical sensors to determine and communicate the locked / unlocked status of your secured drawer. LockQuery automatically updates whenever the zero5 app is opened.
Full 1:1 scale model recently completed
As LifeStyleLock continues to march toward a zero5 product release weâ€™ve developed multiple 1:1 scale models. These models enable our team to review product geometry, color, texture, and a variety of material attributes.
LifeStyleLock zero5 model in metallic titanium, with a titanium badge
Our ambition is to build a world-class product that inspires confidence as soon as you open the package. We obsess over every detail to ensure we build a product that provides many years of satisfaction and security.
Advanced personal property protection
The zero5 is not a lightweight â€œthrow-awayâ€ consumer product. The zero5 is an advanced security device built to the highest standards to ensure those items you intended to secure...remain secure.
The zero5 features a proprietary nickel-plated, hardened-steel lock designed to provide overwhelming â€œpassive holding forceâ€ and â€œzero residual holding forceâ€.
â€œPassive holding forceâ€ means your zero5 doesnâ€™t require power to remain secure. 
â€œZero residual holding forceâ€ means your equipped drawer will open naturally when unlocked.
zero5 Specifications
Powerful - In excess of 500 pounds of "passive" holding force. The zero5 will remain secure without power.  
Smartphone-controlled - iOS, Android
Compact - 1.5â€ deep x 3.5â€ wide x 5.5â€ tall
Discreet / Zero-footprint - Hidden from view, requires no floor space
Bluetooth-enabled - Secure, wireless communication
Housing - The zero5 housing is made of 30% glass-reinforced nylon for high impact resistance and superior structural integrity. The housing is engineered to withstand multiple hammer strikes.  
TamperSenseTM - Tamper alerts sent to a paired smartphone
LockQueryTM - Real-time lock status reported to the zero5 app
Auto-Relock - The user simply closes the drawer and the zero5 will automatically relock
Long-life lithium-ion battery backup - The lithium-ion battery pack is designed to enable lock access in the event of AC power failure. The battery pack will sustain the zero5 for up to 60 days without AC support.

The locking mechanism:
The zero5 leverages a proprietary solenoid locking mechanism. This lock is built in the same manner as locks built for industrial uses. In other words it is capable of very long life in harsh environments. 

The essence of our lock is its â€œpassiveâ€ holding force. Holding force in this case is considered passive because power isn't required for the lock to remain secure. Not only does this improve energy efficiency, but if the zero5 loses all power, AC and DC, it will nonetheless remain secure. 

The lock achieves very long life through an inherently simple, elegant design (our testing indicates 100,000+ cycles, or 20+ years of life). An electric coil is used to energize and thus actuate the lock. The coil remains energized to hold the lock in an unlocked state. Onboard firmware and sensors orchestrate lock action to ensure your interaction with the lock is entirely natural. 

We began developing the locking mechanism in April 2014. We rendered the first working prototype in July and have been refining it ever since. 

The very first "pull test" in July 2014 is captured in a short video below.  When this video was taken the lock components were not yet "hardened" and yet the lock withstood 440 pounds of pull force. In a hardened state the zero5 lock easily withstands 500+ pounds of pull force.        


PLAY


There are only a couple of moving parts to our lock assembly - fewer moving parts means fewer points of failure. We use specialized CNC turning machines to generate extremely high finished part tolerances. All critical part dimensions are held within 0.005â€. Special long-life plating and surface treatment ensures moving parts slide easily. Our lock can sit idle for extended periods, then actuate when commanded to do so. On December 17, 2014 we expect to begin accelerated life testing of the final lock design. 

How can we hold the lock in place within the zero5 housing such that this doesnâ€™t represent the â€œweak linkâ€? 
We configured a lip that spans the circumference of the lock body. Then we developed a ring that sits atop that lip. The ring in turn is mounted with four special load-bearing screws, each of which can hold 700 pounds. 

zero5 solenoid lock mounting
How does the lock â€œsenseâ€ that Iâ€™m closing the drawer? 
We employ small, very sensitive optical sensors to detect the closing drawer. Once detected, the lock instantly unlocks. And we mean instantlyâ€¦think a few millisecondsâ€¦you can literally slam the drawer shut! The solenoid remains open until it receives additional sensor input indicating your drawer has been closed. Once these sensors are alerted, we report the â€œlockedâ€ status back to your smartphone. 

The video below shows a brief demonstration of a zero5 prototype.  In this case Rich is interacting with our "test" application in order to demonstrate the following: establish a wireless connection to the zero5, execute an unlock command, observe the LockQuery status change to "Unlock", observe the natural Auto-Relock function (Rich simply closes the drawer), and observe the LockQuery status change to "Lock".  The test application Rich is using is designed for development purposes. The consumer version of the zero5 smartphone app is pictured above.

Does installation require a high degree of precision? 
Weâ€™ve configured our lock and drawer assembly such that combined the zero5 can accommodate a high degree of imprecision in the installation. [Note: All zero5 installation hardware will mount from the inside. There will be no exposed fasteners.]

Weâ€™re currently engineering a drawer assembly that makes precise installation simpler still. Essentially, youâ€™re merely asked to drill a reasonably straight hole. LifeStyleLock provides a template and fixture that facilitates installation. Iâ€™ve often said it was much harder to assemble my sonâ€™s first Big Wheel than to install the very first generation zero5! 

Whatâ€™s in the zero5 housing? 
There are three primary elements: 
The lock itself is 1.7â€ in diameter and 1â€ tall. 
There are two printed circuit board assemblies (PCBA). The primary PCBA hosts the Bluetooth (BLE) module with integral microcontroller, the clock crystal, the 3-axis accelerometer, and a collection of capacitors, amplifiers, resistors, rectifiers, etc. the primary role of which is to groom power, whether derived from the wall or battery pack. 
The battery pack is comprised of two lithium-ion cells. These individual cells are wrapped and â€œconnectorizedâ€ to create a convenient pack. Like many consumer products builders weâ€™ve debated the role of the battery at length. On the one hand we want to manage costs. On the other we want to deliver a worry-free, â€œset it and forget itâ€ ownership experience. We chose to invest in a sophisticated battery pack that will drive the zero5 for up to 60 days without any AC support. Because weâ€™re using Bluetooth (BLE) the user will be able to interact with their zero5 in the same manner whether it's running on battery or wall power. And because the zero5 remains plugged in, the battery will last for five or more years. When replacement becomes necessary, weâ€™ve designed a simple, elegant battery door for ease of access. 
The zero5 housing: 
The primary housing component is molded using glass-reinforced nylon. This material provides the right blend of impact resistance and structural integrity. The housing design employs internal bracing to improve material flow during the molding process, and enhance structural strength. The primary housing and mating metal plate are designed to withstand multiple hammer strikes. 
zero5 cutaway with mating ball entering housing
The load-bearing back plate is fabricated out of alloy steel, then painted to match the highlight color used on the front panel. The zero5 looks lightweight in photos, and yet when you hold it youâ€™re surprised by its heft. Itâ€™s a serious security device, built for a high degree of impenetrability and rock solid reliability. 
The front face includes a decorative back-painted composite element and decorative badge. We felt it was very important to create a product that delivered an emotional reaction when first seen. The back-painted composite element enables LifeStyleLock to deliver a broad collection of colors to suit the tastes of our consumer. The badge, in turn, is a seriously cool branding element. 
In our opinion, the industrial design of the zero5 reflects our concern for every last detail. We want to deliver a product that lasts for 20 years or more. While we canâ€™t predict the state of communications technology two decades out, we can ensure that we build a lock that will work for 20 years and believe weâ€™ve done so with the zero5.

Frequently Asked Questions - 
Is the zero5 really a do-it-yourself installation?
The zero5 was built for do-it-yourself installation. If you have a tape measure, cordless drill and a Phillips screwdriver, chances are very good that youâ€™ve taken on harder projects than the zero5 installation.
How difficult is the zero5 installation?
The installation should only take about 15 minutes. If youâ€™re like me, it will take you longer to get your tools together than the installation itself! Please read and understand the installation guide before beginning the install. 
Can anyone install the zero5? 
If youâ€™re not comfortable with a DIY project, your favorite handyman or building super should be able to perform the install for you. This should be someone that you are comfortable allowing in your home. 
What happens when the power goes out?
The LifeStyleLock zero5 comes with an AC wall adapter and should be plugged in at all times. When the power goes out, the zero5 switches automatically to the on-board battery back-up.
How long will the batteries last?
If AC power is lost the battery pack enables access to the zero5 for up to 60 days. The more the lock is operated, the shorter the battery life.  Once AC is restored the battery is again gradually charged.  
What if someone tampers with or attempts to breach the zero5 or the furniture?
The zero5 is equipped with a 3-axis accelerometer. When movement or vibration is detected, the zero5 will send a TamperSense alert notifying you of an attempted breach.
How does Bluetooth work?  
Bluetooth enables direct local communication between two Bluetooth enabled devices.  Bluetooth does not require an internet connection or wireless hotspot.  LifeStyleLock will utilize a security protocol to ensure only authorized Bluetooth-enabled devices may unlock your zero5.       
Can I connect more than one device to the zero5? 
Yes, during the configuration you will have an opportunity to â€˜authorizeâ€™ another device. You should have that device available during the configuration as you will be asked to enter the MEID. 
Can we have more than one zero5 in the house? 
Yes, you can install multiple zero5â€™s, his and her nightstands in the master bedroom, a dresser in the guest room or desk in the office. During the configuration, you will be able to enter a new â€˜identityâ€™ for each LifeStyleLock zero5. 
Our product certifications: 
Bluetooth module - FCC, CE, UL

LifeStyleLockTM, TamperSenseTM, LockQueryTM, and Security EverydayTM have been submitted to the USPTO for trademark protection. Various proprietary features of the zero5 are patent pending.
Security and Insight
Lock-Bot is designed to be secure.  It uses its internet connection to its advantage. Our ability to regularly request status from Lock-Bot allows us to ensure that its contents are always properly protected.  We can check on the status of the RFID key chain to see if your guest has checked out, or if the key is missing.  Lok-Bot is more than just some quiet lock. Its ability to use infinite access codes, and to communicate, enhances security.
If security were all that mattered, however, our software would have been easier to create.  Instead, we sought to put property owners in the know.  Whether they're right next door or across the continent, Lock-Bot gives them better insight into the rental process and improves their peace of mind.

Lock-Bot Team
Schedule
Our plan is to get a quality device put together that will last our customer a lifetime.  We've already begun working through our part-manufacturing plan with an eye to balancing cost and durability.  In addition, we realize that our software has to be truly tamper-proof.  We are using enterprise class frameworks and security protocols, and we're testing every step of the way.  The goal is to have our early release products ready to ship to supporters by May.  This goal has been set with an understanding of all the steps we need to take (including grabbing a bit of padding).
Why did we create the Lock-Bot?
A Story:
It all began on a trip to Puerto Rico in 2013.  I was heading out on a surfing adventure, but my flight was delayed, which meant that I wouldnâ€™t be arriving in Puerto Rico until 3:00 a.m.  In addition to my worries about being too tired to surf, I was very concerned that I wouldnâ€™t be able to open the little cottage that I had booked through an online property listing site. The handÂ­-off of my rental arrangements from the booking website to the property owner had made details about checking in a little unclear. 
I realized I would have to reach out by phone for clarification.  Would they answer?  Would they be angry about the late hour? Itâ€™s really nerveÂ­-wracking to know youâ€™re going to have to call and try to wake someone up at 3:00 a.m. 
I wasnâ€™t even sure what number to call.  There was a number on the email that I had received confirming the trip, so I did what I had to do.
I ended up waking a man whom the property owner had arranged to watch the cottage. Iâ€™m not sure what he was paid, but I can assure you it wasnâ€™t enough.  He informed me that there was a lockbox on the door and that the code was (believe it or not) the last four digits of the phone number I had just dialed.  Iâ€™m not sure who came up with that system, but I think itâ€™s safe to assume that, as long as they possess mediocre shortÂ­-term memory skills, the scores of surfers renting the cottage over the years wonâ€™t need to wake the guy up in the middle of the night ever again.  
Coming from a banking background, where security is top priority, I pondered how broken and potentially expensive for the property owner the manâ€™s phone number system was.  I thought about how unnerving it was to be in an unfamiliar place and not know how I was going to get into my room.
I really love to travel, and Iâ€™m thrilled at the prospect of renting more personal properties. I think HomeAway, AirBnB and other sites are the future, and I was inspired by the cracks in the system to begin thinking of a better, more secure way for vacationers and property owners to connect.
Our Design Journey
Design Refinement
Finally
The final design for the prototype came from Todd Mendoza at Priority Designs.  He created a more secure "lock-like" structure with a recessed door.  He added the chamfered molding and designed the secure mounting bracket.  The bracket allows for installation and removal only when the lock is in the open position.  We love the way it looks now and are choosing new materials for the production model.
Final design for the prototype
As a car owner I have always been concerned about my carâ€™s safety. My fear is justified, because more than 17 million cars are stolen annually worldwide.. The official Interpol database is flooded with 7 million records of stolen cars. 
It is certainly true that car insurance can help if your car is stolen, but it is very expensive and it does nâ€™t always cover 100% of the loss, especially when taking into account the stress and inconvenience of being left without a car.  Also, there are many anti-theft systems available and we will get to closer to comparing Wibou to systems currently available in the market later on.
How to protect a car without interfering with car wires and systems? 
Wibouâ€™s main advantage is that NO  installation in the car is required.. With Wibou, your car is not touched or modified in any way at all. Wibouâ€™s sensor is only installed above the car, on the garage ceiling, and absolutely nothing is installed inside the car. 
Wibou uses your smartphoneâ€™s  unique identification system to allow multiple users to control the carâ€™s alarm simultaneously, so that you and your family members or authorized staff can unlock the carâ€™s position.  Any other unauthorized movement sends an alert to your phone immediately.
Wibou
In this basic version, the system automatically locks your car into place secured with Wibou. All you have to do in to unlock the car with your smartphone prior to leaving.
Alarm
If someone wants to steal your car, the system detects unauthorized movement and send an instant alarm to your phone.  In the version with camera, you will also receive pictures.
Let's talk tech.
We have decided to use open source sytem OpenPicus. It is nice, small and suitable for our needs.  
All connections to our servers are done with security in mind. When the connection to our servers is lost, you will receive an alert . If the car is stolen, you will receive an alarm.
Installation
Installation and first time registration is done as simple as possible.
1. Mount Wibou to the desired location.
2. Connect your smartphone to Wibou SSID
3. Open your browser and fill in your home wifi SSID data so Wibou can connect to the internet.
4. Register at our website 
5. Download our application from Googleplay and login.
6. Youâ€™re done!
With WIBOU you can ...
secure your car
receive alerts when car is moved from place
check log files
manage users
Prerequisite
internet connection
home router with WiFi
smart phone (android or iphone)
Wibou :)
Wibou is available in 2 version. Basic and with camera.
We also offer a Wibou version with a camera, for users who want to make absolutely certain the car is still there,even if the system says everything is ok.  Additionally,  in case of an alarm they can confirm that the car is actually missing This version also allows access to a recording of the several seconds before  the actual event that triggered the alarm, which can be very useful in investigating a crime or identifying the unauthorized user. 
Additional  feature our system offers 
If someone else parks a car in your parking space, with Wibou the owner is notified immediately. This feature is perfect for multi-user garages where such things happen occasionally. Subscribers in public garages often face this difficulty and our system helps prevent such situations. 
First Idea, first solutions and prototypes.
We got this idea while we were trying to find a solution to immediate notification of car owner in case of car movement from its parking space.
First hardware platform was "Raspberry pie" open hardware solution connected with simple ultra sonic sensor. This solutions was sufficient for first tests and first prototype but very soon we have realized it is too bulky and offers much more then we actually need for our system. We have found open hardware solutions then on market which we then customized with our partners help. We have removed all hardware that our system does not enquirer and made it more efficient and energy saving.
Prototypes
We have put great effort in making our system user friendly, we have tested our system in many occasions and during that phase have changed user interface to suit most natural way of using smart phone apps.
While using wibou we thought about so called "automated lock". This feature automatically locks cars position under sensor and no action on smart phone application is required. In that case one can not forger to activate car protection, a case that often happens with security systems.
WIBOU testing and new features discoveries
Also while seeing WIBOU in use in our testing locations we have thought about this great feature that solves a problem commonly present problem in residential garages with predefined parking spaces. In case someone parks in your parking space you can react immediately. It is much easier to notify building security or member of staff to solve the problem immediately then to spend a lot of time wondering where that ignorant car owner may be in moment of actual owners arrival. We are sure we will discover some other features of our system and we of course encourage you our backers and users to help us with your ideas. Any idea we can implement we will try and of course let know inventor how are doing in that particular field.
WIBOU car security system and other HOME SECURITY systems.
Comparing WIBOU to existing anti-theft systems requires a little imagination because a a similar system has not been invented yet. 
Trying to put together similar features and copying Wibouâ€™s functionality Wibou requires quite a few pieces of equipment joined together.
First, one would need a motion sensor in a garage, which brings with it the added challenge of differentiating between ANY movement in the garage and unwanted movement. 
Second, one would need a GSM module or email. While this is easy, it can be costly and thieves can block or interfere with the signal. Also, emails are unreliable and for sms we need to pay additional fees, so beside the initial investment we are also looking at monthly fees when using this alternative. 
Third, to replicate the effect of the Wibou camera feature, an IP camera would be needed for those who wish to see what is going on at their property as well. Putting all this together will require an experienced technician and the costs could easily reach $1,000. , 
The other alternative is a basic home security system, which covers the entire house, not just the garage and car in it. With work and all features it will cost you around 1500$ to set it all up, also not possible without technicians running up and down your house for couple of hours and paying monthly fees for gsm alarms.
Wibou is an innovative, affordable and functional system. For a one-time cost equal to 1% of an average carâ€™s value (assuming the average car is worth $20,000). You can keep your car safe from both thieves, as well as unauthorized use by family members, or co-workers ( in business fleets).

The Door Notifier is the next big product in the IoT world. It allows a single door or compartment to be alarmed through the internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the effort to make everything interconnected in terms of data. Well known products in this category are wifi enabled thermostats (see Nest) and outlets(see WeMo). The Door Notifier takes this to the next step. It allows any door to join the Internet of Things.
This device gives you the ability to put an alarm on anything that opens with very basic configuration and a quick setup. In as little as 5 minutes you can have a fully functional alarm system that notifies you via your cell phone or any other method over the internet.
The concept is simple and its usage is even simpler. Connect it to your computer to select your WiFi network and set the email or phone number to be notified. After configuration it can be as simple as double sided taping it to the wall next to the door. It also has the ability to be screwed to the doorjamb for more secure operation.
Simply Put Open door, your phone tells you. Close door, Your phone tells you.
The units support multiple modes for notification. The simple ones are to notify when the door is opened or closed. It can also be set to more complex modes such as detecting that the door is left open or left closed. It supports different profiles for different days and time spans as well. It can also do custom messages allowing for simple use of multiple units.
Upon detecting the user set action, it can notify the user in a number of ways. The basic functionality is an email, text message, phonecall, or app, all supporting custom messages. It can also push the data to servers or to the cloud for analysis and monitoring. Patent pending.
The unit has successfully been tested on cabinets, swing doors, french doors, bifold doors, overhead doors, drawers, safes, microwaves and refrigerators. If you need verification of function in a specific environment don't hesitate to ask.
There are plans for four models:
Basic: This is the entry level model. Every other model builds upon this. This model can do basic notifications to your cell phone or any other internet based service and is powered over micro USB.
RTC:   This module includes a Real Time Clock. It adds the ability for timestamps, complex time modes, and deep sleep modes to the basic module. This allows for logging and more accurate reporting during network outages.
Battery: This adds a battery backup and battery power to the basic model. It has a removable lithium based rechargeable battery. This unit is also charged and powered over micro USB.
RTC+Battery: This is our most feature rich module. It has the ability to process complex time constraints with the ability to deep sleep and conserve battery life.
We suggest that users that would like battery for portable use get the RTC+Battery module to conserve battery life. All models come with Micro usb cable for power. Any old USB cellphone charger should be compatible. We can include one per unit for an additional pledge.
Common uses:
Basic Alarm System
Keep children out of places like pools
Detection of people leaving or arriving
Counting of people entered or exiting
Verify that doors are closed remotely
Verify that doors are left open remotely
Make sure your roommate doesn't steal your food
Reminders to check things periodically if they haven't been
Any door that needs monitoring in any way
 What differentiates our product from the current offerings by other companies is that ours is a standalone unit. For comparable functionality you would require a full security system installed. Even with those measures taken it still lacks the customizability of the Wifi Door Notifier. Additionally ours is fully scalable limited only by local IP address availability. This limitation can be overcome easily with a custom network solution
I was lucky that the first prototype functioned fully as designed upon assembly. The two sensors shown in the video are actually the first two prototypes ever made! The only changes made since their construction were code revisions to add features and reduce memory consumption.
All prices are discounted for kickstarter backers. All future purchases outside of kickstarter will be more expensive.
Multiple units can be purchased by adding the cost per unit to your pledge plus $1 per unit for shipping. Upon completion surveys will be sent out for final quantities.
Completion upon starting Kickstarter
I am starting this kickstarter having a functioning prototype, a provisional patent, and the first revision of the PCB Designed. Based on my assumed volume of purchase the delivery dates listed are decently later than I anticipate. I am using Kickstarter's, "Underpromise, overdeliver" as my basis for these dates. Deliveries will all take place upon completion and certification of models. If the volume is high I will make tiered delivery dates. 
Your funding supports:
Geting this company off the ground
Paying for FCC Certification
Paying for non-provisional patents
You are being watched.
Governments around the world are violating your rights with widespread digital surveillance, spanning the entire globe.
I have some security software installed. Am I safe?
NO. Mass surveillance systems are not stopped by virus scanners, security suites, firewalls or other common security software. Mass surveillance relies on problems with network connections, apps and internet services to collect information about you. What is not collected through these methods is taken from companies that hold your information by court order in multiple countries.
What is OSTIF, why do you exist? 
The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is an organization for strengthening open source security software projects. I know that is a mouthful of technical jargon. So lets break it down. Open source software is software that is created in the open by a community. Everyone can see how this software is made and can trust that this software will do exactly what it is supposed to do.

On the other hand, commercial software is often close-source code. This means that you can only see the software working after you install it. No one can see the actual code. Programmers cannot look at the code and verify that the software will always do exactly what it is supposed to do because all of these underlying functions are hidden. This means that close-source software can be subject to sabotage, either by manipulating the code to make it less secure (a back door) or by finding security problems that go unfixed because programmers cannot review the source code for the app (bugs).

For this reason, open source security software is the only type of security software that we can all trust is mostly free of disastrous bugs and completely free of back doors.

Our goals take this one step further. We take the open source software and get it looked over by professionals, line by line. We then also add the software to a program where anyone in the world can hunt for bugs in the open source code, and if they find a serious one, they can get a paycheck from us, called a bug bounty. This encourages a LOT of people to look at the code and find bugs. These things combined make open source security software stronger and more trustworthy.
Why should I care about surveillance? How does this impact me?
If you found out the government was intercepting all of your mail and reading it, would you be concerned? Does your opinion change if it is your medical records? Letters from your attorney? Financial information?

The truth is that it is far worse than that. They are looking at your email, location data, phone records, browsing habits, text messages, chat logs, your social media and even pilfering passwords from weak systems.

EVEN IF your answer to the previous paragraph is "so what? I have nothing to hide." You should consider the impact that this has on free speech, freedom to assemble, a free press, patient-doctor confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, and so much more. Just because you are not concerned about your personal information (you should be anyway!) it doesn't mean that other people do not have information that is valuable. This information can be used to sway elections, sabotage business negotiations, or even round up people of an opposing political party.

EVEN FURTHER if you don't care about the implications in your home country, you should consider the impact that free and open software has on the world stage. There are places where people are jailed or even murdered for speaking out about their beliefs, for speaking out against the government or simply for being born into the wrong family. Free and open security software has the power to protect people who have no other recourse.
What is the supported software? How do I get it? 
All of this software is available to use right now, for free. OSTIF is working to make this software better.

VeraCrypt - For encrypting your files.
OpenVPN - For encrypting connections over the internet, securely.
Off the Record - (Windows version is Pidgin + Plugin) Encrypted chats
Off the Record - (Apple OSX version is Adium) Encrypted chats
GnuPG - (Windows version is GPG4WIN) Encrypting Email and Files
GnuPG - (Apple OSX version is GnuPG for OSX) Encrypting Email and Files
OpenSSL - This project is special, it is built into a huge number of apps and it used for servers to host secure web pages. You do not need to download it.
Tor - A fully encrypted network that you connect to for privacy. More powerful than OpenVPN but slower.
Mailvelope - A plugin for Chrome and Firefox that allows you to more easily encrypt webmail, like gmail, yahoo, outlook. It uses the OpenPGP framework (which is open source).
Your KickStarter goal seems high. Where is all of this money going?
OSTIFs goal figures are a result of the inherent costs of running a KickStarter (7.5% to 10% overhead) along with the actual cost of the programs. Our organization is organized from the top-down to be efficient and eliminate all possible sources of waste.
The problem with open source software, and the reason that these projects need our support in the first place, is that open source software is easy to copy and therefore has low monetary value and no profit motive. The projects are created and maintained by people who donate their time and expertise. Without having any money involved in these projects, setting up advanced auditing and bug bounty programs (both of which are expensive) are impossible for these projects to manage themselves, yet the threat of mass surveillance and the consequences of vulnerabilities means that this software should be as strong as possible.
A breakdown of expenses including KickStarter
Our expenses for KickStarter inflate our numbers quite a bit. We have to pay for printing for certificates and t-shirts and pay for shipping including international shipping. Under normal conditions a donation would have 90% of its amount applied to the cause. For KickStarter the processing fees and rewards eat up half of that 90%.
It is also important to understand that software auditing is expensive. There are less than 20,000 people in the world that are qualified to handle this sort of task and they command large salaries, and professional auditing is usually done by a team of these talented programmers and cryptographers that specialize in different areas of software security.
The figures are essentially the same for our stretch goals, although the projects are different, our fixed costs as an organization are very low, and the money that gets to us after KickStarter expenses almost entirely goes to the projects cited below in our fundraiser goals.
How do I use it? 
This section will be updated with guide videos. If we cannot locate good guide videos, we will create them ourselves. We were unable to find videos that were sufficiently simple for new users to understand. New videos are being shot and edited now.
How did you select projects to support? 
We selected these projects based on their purpose and their potential. We needed to select an app to protect your chats (Off the Record), an app to protect your network connections (OpenVPN), open encryption code that is used by other applications (OpenSSL), an app to protect data on your hard drive (VeraCrypt), an app to protect your email and its attachments (GnuPG). 
Off the Record and GnuPG were selected because there is strong evidence that they are actually unbreakable, as revealed by the disclosures of Edward Snowden. OpenVPN was selected because it is widely used, and it works for Windows, Apple OSX, Linux, and BSD. OpenSSL was selected because it is widely used, having a 69% market share in top 1,000,000 websites. VeraCrypt was selected because it is the successor to the powerful TrueCrypt software, and has the potential to be a worldwide gold standard for file encryption.
How do we support these goals?
By donating to our cause, and by spreading the word about OSTIF and mass surveillance.
Project Goals
Our Kickstarter campaign includes four sets of goals, from our primary goals to three sets of stretch goals should we exceed funding for our primary goal. The figures we have reached are based on multiple price quotes for services from companies that we would entrust to carry out our project goals.
Rewards
We are also revealing our T-shirt designs for Gold and Platinum KickStarter Supporters!
The gold designs are pretty self-explanatory. You will be able to select any of the gold supporter designs and choose your front and back (see below).
Gold Donor T-Shirt Designs
We have unique designs for our Platinum supporters. Platinum supporters get a special shirt with a QR code and custom URL, that takes you directly to an OSTIF page with a personalized thank you from us, that is cryptographically signed by us and impossible to forge. Here is an example page! 
https://ostif.org/113c7b5a52b2a64fd516e5845e47babbf037a5ee473103b08742f2d77c63a632/ 
You also get designs that are more complex with more colors, and a very special design to me, the OTR document shirt. The OTR document shirt is the actual Snowden document that was released by Jacob Appelbaum and Laura Poitras at 31c3 (i believe with the help of Der Spiegel). It is the document that revealed to the world that governments can not break real crypto. This moment was the moment that motivated me personally to act, and to support strong open crypto to fight government surveillance. You can see the actual reveal here: https://youtu.be/0SgGMj3Mf88?t=32m29s
Platinum T-Shirt Designs
Social Media
We believe in the power of community and understand that everyone can make a difference. If you're on board with our mission, spread the word!

YOUR DREAM OF SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER INTERNET EVERYWHERE IS COMING TRUE!
Help us bring you one of the biggest improvements to data transmission since the invention of the TCP/IP packet 50 years ago. We call is SpeedStealth! â„¢
Our unique algorithm is being developed for every major operating system, providing a BREAKTHROUGH in Internet speed and securityâ€”regardless of your service provider.
Help fund continued development of our consumer versions for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Chromebook and Linux -- the more funding we get the faster we code and deploy!
We share your dream for faster Internet:
â€¢ Increased speed! Throughput, speed, and reliability will be significantly improved on any Internet device--at home, hotspots, hotels, airports, everywhere, especially rural and/or congested networks!
Beta test results are awesome!
â€¢ Saves you time and money! Faster downloads, skip-free/buffer-free video, fluid gaming, secure connectionsâ€¦All with fewer data packets delivered! For example, a 50 megabyte (MB) file may consume 100, 200, maybe even 500+ MBs of your data plan. With our software you can usually get those files downloaded without consuming so much of your data plan, which can save you money.
â€¢ Reduce or eliminate dropped or lost data packets (the Internet moves data in packets and most networks lose some in the process, slowing down your experience).
WHO BENEFITS? Anyone that uses the Internet and values their time!
Travelers, Gamers, Remote Users, Video Watchers, Rural ISP Customers, Presenters, Business Users, Researchers, Entertainment Consumers â€“ anyone who wants faster, more secure connectivity (with less data consumption and better battery life) -- wherever they connect.
Better quality Netflix example
Sounds too good to be true? Every revolutionary change in technology seemed to have been impossible â€“ until it was done. Who would have thought in the 70â€™s you could have thousands of songs in your pocket?
Itâ€™s been tested by (and invented by) several prestigious universities â€“ IT WORKS.
WHY HAVENâ€™T I HEARD OF THIS BEFORE? The underlying software was invented by a group of universities, but they didnâ€™t figure out how to effectively commercialize it. Itâ€™s like inventing an engine without figuring out the rest of the car â€“ itâ€™s cool, but not very useful for getting around. Weâ€™ve built the rest of the car â€“ weâ€™ve figured out how to get it on your devices easily and how you can enjoy the speed without your needing an engineering degree.
MAKING IT REAL: In the next few months, SpeedStealth will be available for smartphones, computers and tablets, and we want to provide you with the chance to be among the first to use this revolutionary service and to prove for yourself that we can increase your Internet reliability and speed on connections of all types.
Our service uses an â€˜appâ€™ you install on your computer, tablet or smartphone to connect to our cloud servers over a special VPN. After that, we operate in the background, using our cloud servers to move your content to you at the fastest possible speeds (uploads are faster too).
In a nutshell, SpeedStealth removes bottlenecks that slow your connections down. The degree of improvement depends on the quality of the connection â€“ the worse it is, the more we can improve it. In one instance weâ€™ve seen up to 30 times speed increase but we expect â€œnormalâ€ to be 4 to 10 times faster. (see our YouTube video of a real world test at https://youtu.be/lhgw64cH77c. Not the best quality video, but 5 times speed improvement).
Again, the technology behind our service has been tested and it works. In addition to the university validation, internal beta testing has shown consistent substantial improvements in upload and download speeds across a variety of devices and networks. We can hardly wait to deliver all of this to youâ€¦.when its ready!
Because this service is for the masses, please help us with your dollars and feedback to continue to evolve the core technology to work for you on all of your devices.
We need your Kickstarter funds to help us finish the beta versions and develop deployable versions of our software for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Chromebook and Linux platforms and to distribute VPN servers for the best possible user experience.
HOW IT WORKS. SpeedStealth re-formats Internet traffic by adding a little math to the data that allows lost or damaged data packets to be rebuilt on your device, reducing the need to resend and reprocess lost data. It also doesnâ€™t require packets to be received in order, like with normal TCP/IP. This, means your connections will become much more efficient by significantly reducing re-transmission of lost packets, and with that efficiency comes improved throughput, or speed. You actually experience a speed increase while using less data (i.e. making your current service even cheaper in many cases while also conserving battery life!)
We are NOT a form of compression, caching, or Forward Error Correction or software which re-configures your settings, or cleans off old files. SpeedStealth IS a packet-tagging and packet assembly and successful packet delivery program that uniquely requires far less processing power and adds substantially less overhead to your data transmission than these other choices.
Speed is good and so is security! In addition to making your communications faster, SpeedStealth makes communications more secure. The â€˜mathâ€™ and the private network mentioned above also serve to encrypt your data, making it possible to shop on-line at the coffee shop with less fear of getting your accounts hacked.
Our service uses a patented process, developed by some of the worldâ€™s most elite universities and proven in industry, and even space, helping assure the data you send (or receive) gets to where itâ€™s sent first time, every time, and securely.
Using another automotive analogy; we turbo-charge your car, add lights and siren and provide you an HOV lane to your Internet destination.
REALITY-CHECK: We can't make your ISP connection carry more packets than the physical limit placed on it by the ISP, but we can eliminate re-transmission of data so that the bandwidth is not consumed with redundant traffic. On most networks you will see 3 to 10 times speed improvements using SpeedStealth.
Even though Bob says: "For a small investment you can be one of the first people to enjoy SpeedStealth, the fastest Internet ever." To make the lawyers happy, let us clarify: We are not selling any securities, and you are not â€œinvestingâ€ in our company. Instead, Bob uses the term â€œinvestmentâ€ to mean "to buy something whose usefulness will repay the cost."
Final point: We wonâ€™t help much, if at all if you happen to be on such an amazing network there is no data loss. Such networks do exist, but they are rare, and almost non-existent in the wireless realm where more and more of us are connecting. If the only time you use the Internet is at 4 AM to watch a movie over a hard-wired fiber optic connection at home, we may not be able to help. But for the vast majority of users who don't have that kind of amazing data life, (but apparently would like to get a life) we can help.
OUR OFFER: Please help us by supporting our efforts and you will receive the corresponding perks based on your support-level, which represent a substantial discount from our base prices. We hope this campaign will provide funding to have the above mentioned platforms ready in the fall. Please tell your friends and business associates. The more users, the better we can make the service. It will allow us to place servers around the country and the world, further improving performance and giving us a physically diverse network.
Please help us bring you FASTER INTERNET. EVERYWHERE! 
Thank you! Inneuvate, LLC, makers of SpeedStealth

PROJECT DETAILS:
We have built a handful of functional prototypes: first from 3D printing, then from similar materials, and now we have a handful of actual production material functional prototypes.  It's been a long design process with lots to consider.  After some less than pretty prototypes, and some excellent changes made along the way, we've come to what we think, and what we hope you think, is a very nice looking elegant way to handle your iPads.
On successful funding, the $60,000 funding goal will be used to launch us to market with our first run of production units.  
All our manufacturers are set and ready to build as fast as we can order.  We have all the first-time upfront expenses taken care of (molds & tooling).  The supply chain for all the 44 parts(depending how they're counted) is in place and our contract assembly plant, is ready to start putting them together.  
Pledge rewards are expected to go smoothly and be delivered on time.
Make sure to like our project with the Facebook button above, and no matter what amount you decide to pledge, tell your friends and associates about our project.  We hope your excitement springs from our excitement to stir the excitement of the people you know, and so forth!  We really appreciate your support in anyway you can give it!
OmniVu Presents The uVu Demo Video
Applying and registering for uVu membership is simple. Take a look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhctfDfC9Fg&feature=youtu.be
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Story

This chapter in my story began some years ago when I decided to take on the responsibility of becoming a stay-at-home dad. I took an extended hiatus to raise my three daughters. During that time, I was prompted to create the uVu technology by the amount of objectionable material and those of questionable character and motivations that my young daughters were exposed to as well as ID theft and credit card fraud that my family and I experienced online. I thought that there had to be a way to authenticate a persons identity online yet preserve their anonymity; allowing people to use their aliases and avatars to maintain there public privacy. After all, my family and I wanted to maintain our privacy online. It took a great deal of time to conceive of and design the uVu technology. The uVu technology is a very user friendly online identity verification and enrollment solution with the most layers of security available to users for free which allows people to keep their anonymity. Only the uVu technology knows the true identity of users.

Another aspect that I had to consider was that my previous technological innovations were developed and launched long before the various markets were ready. The lesson learned was that I would have to create the intellectual property whereby the various technologies to be used had to  be considered "cutting edge" and enable me to secure the IP with patents, yet  familiar enough whereby they would be immediately embraced by the various markets. Timing is everything. We've reached a point in the evolution of the Internet whereby the need for greater security is paramount to maintaining a sound environment for conducting commerce and overall communications with confidence.

Like most entrepreneurs, I desire to keep the creative integrity of my vision and maintain momentum in bringing this venture to the various markets. In the past, I have unintentionally agreed to relinquish visionary rights to investors, only to have control lorded over me with the drive to make as much money as fast as possible using unsound business principles. Keeping a steady pace with a sustainable growth rate with enduring influence within the various markets was what I had truly desired and felt destined to achieve. So, please know that a great deal of thoughtful enterprise has gone into the creation of the uVu technology. I trust that you will be pleased with the finished product.

I see my role in this venture as having equal parts as a visionary, facilitator and logistician. I endeavor to align with Top Tier experts in their respective fields to fill key roles and needs for the successful development and launch of this venture for a sustainable future.

I continue to bear in mind the adage of being able to have only two of the three concerns in a start-up venture: Money, Quality and Time. I elect to have Quality and Time knowing that if these two priorities are addressed then the rest will follow.

Please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to addressing any questions or concerns that you may have. I will do my very best to return all correspondence within 24 hours.

Take Care,

Steve

Business Direction
OmniVuâ€™s main business is providing industry with an enhanced identity verification and enrollment solution unmatched by current competitors.Our flagship product, the uVuâ„¢, is a "smart" online biometric registration system which has proprietary technology that enables industry to realize the full potential of scientifically identifying and enrolling consumers in real-time at their computer device. OmniVu's system of gathering, identifying, authenticating, registering, monitoring, tracking, analyzing, storing and distributing biometric data on a mass scale takes online security to the next level.
The uVuâ„¢ technology defines how biometric verification systems make the transition to the world of e-Business with mass consumer appeal.Therefore, we believe that our true competitors have yet to arrive on the commercial scene.However, in evaluating the online identity verification systems, we consider as possible competitors the established verification systems such as those used for online financial transactions. Although similar in purpose and direction, these outlets lack scientific authentication in scope and faculties to provide the accountability and advanced functionality of the uVuâ„¢ on a mass scale.
Another noteworthy aspect of the competition is the type of technology and scale of their deployment. All of the known verification technologies use rudimentary technologies deployed as vulnerable verification solutions on established web sites and in some cases there exists a conflict of interest whereby their cross platforms and business model(s) may financially benefit from any vulnerabilities. Only OmniVu, has the independent vision, business model and advanced cost-effective technology in the uVuâ„¢ to implement a major deployment as a full-blown consumer identity verification and enrollment solution on a massive scale whereby success is measured by an environment of propriety and accuracy not quantity.
Market and Business Opportunities
Target Market & Size
OmniVuâ€™s vision and proprietary technology affords a unique position to penetrate multiple markets. The initial execution of OmniVuâ€™s infrastructure targets the U.S. online gambling industry. U.S. online gambling could be worth $8 billion a year by 2017 (Morgan Stanley). The launch of this stage, aims to maximize market penetration of U.S. online gamblers. OmniVu has set for its initial market potential, 10% of the $8 billion U.S. online gambling market or US $800,000,000.
Highlights - Globally Related
The global online gambling industry had total gross gambling yields of $32.5bn in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0% between 2008 and 2012.
The performance of the industry is forecast to decelerate, with an anticipated CAGR of 8.6% for the period 2012 - 2017, which is expected to drive the industry to a value of $49.2bn by the end of 2017.
Juniper Research estimates that revenues from mobile device gambling alone will top $100 billion by 2017.
Market Needs -The U.S.online gambling industry 's most pressing needs today are:
Reliability.
There are concerns about â€œbecoming a target of criticism and questionable credibility if under-age players participate in an online gambling siteâ€ (Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson). In a recent Forbes column, Adelson writes that online gambling is â€œa threat to our societyâ€”a toxin which all good people ought to resist.â€ He says it will not only take business away from land-based casinos including those run by Native Americans but also endanger children and young adults who are â€œalready dangerously addicted to Internet games.â€
Inventory.
Gambling online in the U.S. has become more difficult, since a number of gambling sites no longer accept customers from this part of the world. Although U.S. residents still have plenty of options to bet on sports, play casino games, or play poker, it is very important to sign up somewhere that is reliable, safe, and with trustworthy age verification capabilities. The blanket legalization of online gambling would create a far more competitive landscape for all aspects of gambling whether skill or chance based. Over 300 offshore gambling operators continue to operate in the U.S. market through more than 1000 online gambling websites.
Regulatory and Technology Threats.
Use of the TOR network allows for anonymity and access through proxy servers, which allows for underage gambling and the exploitation of the vulnerability of the payment process system e.g. money laundering. The Interstate Wire Act of 1961 restricts sports betting but not other types of online gambling. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) of 2006 "prohibits gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in a bet or wager that involves the use of the Internet and that is unlawful under any federal or state law." While much global legislative action focuses on liberalizing online gaming regulations, in many cases these efforts move slowly, and it may take many years for markets to actually open up to licensed competitors even after laws pass. In addition, there is still potential for legislation that is intended to reduce or eliminate online gambling. For example, when the U.S. passed the UIGEA in 2006, many online gambling companies were quickly crippled or forced out of business.
The uVu meets the overall market needs by:
Â·Bridging biometric technology with the online gambling industry providing unparalleled oversight
Â·Incentivizing consumers through frequent user reward programs
Â·Fulfillment of biometric detection and collection devices as needed
Â·Voluntary user registration
Â·Providing scientific accountability with government identity and age authentication to the online gambling industry routed through proprietary systems
Â·Providing millions of new online gambling industry opportunities for legally authenticated and authorized users
Â·Effectively addressed the principal policy concerns that surround online gambling
Anticipated Market Share
OmniVu expects to functionally be in a position to capture a dominant portion of the overall U.S. market for online identity verification and enrollment solutions.
Online Gambling
Product and Service
The uVuâ„¢ is a new online identity verification and enrollment solution that addresses the current legal requirements for online gambling. It provides, for the first time, verifiable accountability as to who, specifically, is accessing the subscriber clientsâ€™ website as well as monitors the users authenticated identification at log in and periodically during session use. Currently, the uVuâ„¢ capabilities include the ability to not only verify the specific identity of an individual but age requirements, geo-location, the monitoring of gambling abuse and the prevention of ID theft, credit card fraud and money laundering.These features enable subscriber clients to adaptively re-program content in real-time to respond to the users demographics, preferences and changing needs.
The uVuâ„¢ is comprised of one or a plurality of biometric detection and collection device(s) connected via a personal computer or mobile device. Fulfilled by OmniVu, the uVuâ„¢ assures a lawful environment to deliver gambling content in any format. The uVuâ„¢ collects, identifies and authenticates biometric markers of a legally recognized living human being, while simultaneously monitoring, tracking, analyzing, storing, and transmitting user verification and environmental data to OmniVu. The uVu only processes biometric markers NOT stored facial or thumbprint images or video footage.
Potential deployment sites are all indoor and mobile personal computing systems connected with the Internet. The number of legally recognized consumerâ€™s suitable for the uVuâ„¢ installations is extensive.
Compared to non-uVuâ„¢ online identity verification and enrollment solutions, OmniVu has a potential market several orders of magnitude greater than that available to any potential competitors. The uVu'sâ„¢ potential consumer base is every consumer that has registered their biometric markers and comes in contact with registered computing devices.

Blumove has important special features built in, such as AES encryption security, Bluetooth BLE technology, distance measuring, search mode, text messaging, automatic alerts and alarms, easy pre-setup parameters, motion sensing, counting, warnings control, log recording, and more
PLAY

Blumove units can be paired with smart phones and use an open connection mode with AES coding. The advantage of this function is that it can be used with several cell phones in the same time and it is possible for the sender to forward information. A smart phone can be paired with approximately 20 Blumove units (based on the memory coverage) that will receive the signals and forward them.
  It can monitor the distance from the smart phone and can send warnings. With the search function, it assists to find a desired Blumove unit. It has a motion detector with sensor (M,L models) that will monitor any movements and sends a signal to a smart phone if anything moves or stops. It can monitor machinery, doors opening, any activity that has motion. In the case of any warnings, it is possible to stop or continue monitoring the activity. In the Blumove menu, it is possible to chose pre-set parameters depending on the need.

History:
Our story started in October 2012!
The big idea came that we should develop a Bluetooth product that can be easily used in our everyday life, sports or hobbies. The Bluetooth technology has arrived to a new stage since a very useful BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) was put on the market. That helps to have a working tool in use for more than a year with one button type battery. It was a big step since we all know that in the past it was a big issue, since the battery of the Bluetooth products did not last too long. The new technology opened new opportunities
In January 2013, we started to collect all the necessary information for product development and we started to work. Our team was ready to start the project by April-May. We contacted Bluetooth S.I.G. and registered with them. We had full support to start the development of the product. The second big step was to choose Laird Technology to develop and produce the radio modules. They have lots of experience and gave us a very favorable proposal. By the summer, the test panel was ready and we could start testing it to develop the best product.
We chose the best parts for the product and we built the basic prototype. The next step was the software development. Soon we bought a license from Apple and started the iOS application development. We had many tasks to complete including panel planing, design, and new solutions.
 
2013 was a very productive and successful year, since we had the Bluetooth beacon with working software. During the iOS development, we realized that we need more technology development than the module and the cell phones operating systems could handle. In January, with Laird Technology, we started the development of a new and unique pairing mode and code. This development opened new opportunities for us and the blumove product could be used better, easier and more securely. The AES encryption technology ensures that the open connection can be used more securely and much easier. It opened the possibility to use the Blumove beacon with more than one cell phone and to the sent data that can be transferred to a cloud system in a very secure mode.
In the spring of 2014, the product was under going serious testing and the Android developments started as well. In April, the product was ready to be introduced. We have started to work on product introduction to the marketplace, media materials and product information finalization. , The prototype and testing is now complete and we would like your support to ramp up production so everybody can enjoy even more this great product.
    REWARDS:
     
Thank you very much for your support in advance.  
The Blumove Team.
Our platform will help people safely exchange emails, files and any secrets using any mail platform. We collect no data from Just Mail usersâ€™ activities. We canâ€™t analyze emails, copy files or give someone else access to them. Any and all data sent through our platform can be deleted in a few seconds without a trace.
What people are saying about Just Mail:
DailyDot - "The dream of easy-to-use encrypted email may have just come true".
How does it work? 
Just Mail is based on the I2P network, proven for decades AES algorithms, public and private keys and it stores data in distributed hash tables. When user sends a email, our app encodes it, divides it and saves it into the distributed network. The addressee receives a magnet link ( similar to torrent ) that allows him to get his email through random nodes. Every Just Mail user will transport and temporary store ( ! ) random parts of hundreds of someone elseâ€™s correspondence which cannot be read if you are not the addressee. ( ! ) Users keep data only during transfer, most of the time we store it on our servers.
Just Mail solves two tasks. Firstly, a truly encrypted email platform. To protect emails we ask every user to make a funny picture. We use image as a source of random data to generate keys. Modern cameras have 8-12 million pixels. If two same cameras will make a picture of the same object anyway these pictures will be different. We take a RAW file and compress it by removing duplicate information. The pure random data is left and we place into keys, making them 100% secure and entirely personal.
Secondly, anonymous data exchange. Our apps send all data to our servers and back via I2P. No one knows what data are transfered by a specific user and where we store a particular file or email. Moreover it makes impossible to track a specific user's location.
Nobody Knows Where is Alice and Bob. 
Unlike many other anonymizing networks, I2P doesn't try to provide anonymity by hiding the originator of some communication and not the recipient, or the other way around. I2P is designed to allow peers using I2P to communicate with each other anonymously â€” both the sender and the recipient are unidentifiable to each other as well as to third parties.
For example, today there are both in-I2P web sites (allowing anonymous publishing / hosting) as well as HTTP proxies to the normal web (allowing anonymous web browsing). Having the ability to run servers within I2P is essential, as it is quite likely that any outbound proxies to the normal Internet will be monitored, disabled, or even taken over to attempt more malicious attacks.
Not for Geeks Only.
Just Mail is a platform built not just for geeks and smart guys who know how to setup Linux. All you need to be secured is to sign up to our platfrom and invite your friends and collegues into protected conversations. You can easily import your emails from any major email platfrom and communicate with the whole world staying safe.
Just Mail users interact with legacy email systems as usual. Data they send not encrypted, but it also goes though I2P to SMTP servers. We have border SMPT servers for this type of communications and to allow users have a custom domains.
One Click Security. 
You can even invite people who donâ€™t have a Just Mail account to Just Mail Conversations by sending a special link via email, social networks or sms, you can print it and fax! When the link is delivered a recipient can automatically sign up under a temporary Just Mail account and communicate with you. It takes a second to generate a link and no more than that to deliver it.
Transport for Everyone. 
We are also working on a completely open API to give developers a great tool to build protected communications inside their programms and use our infrastructure for free. We want to give developers the ability to bring their applications to the new security standard without years of coding.
Where We Are Now? 
The â€œJust Mailâ€ project began in 2013 to search for a fully independent and anonymous way to share data and to make it available to everyone. Much of the Just Mail code has already been done ( basic email client, backend for nodes and gates ) that allows us to exhange mails between I2P network users and traditional SMTP servers. With your support we will be able to finish the platform. You Fund:
Development & Design. Weâ€™ve already built a strong team of programmers and designers who are working on the platform, but all of us have full time jobs which prevent us from devoting all our time to the Just Mail project, but thatâ€™s what we really want to do and thatâ€™s what we will do with your help.
Legal stuff. We need to find a place where we can safely register our company and trademarks, we need to write terms & conditions and we need to be sure that the government canâ€™t shut down the project using force.
Infrastructure. Thatâ€™s the biggest challenge for our team. We've got tons of work to setup and host our dedicated servers around the world to provide seamless email availability and guarantee data rate.
Help us Grow. 
This Kickstarter project is about building a email platform and giving people a way to mail each other - but we don't want to stop there. The majority of popular communication platfroms track what users do and where they are and people donâ€™t have any alternative. Thatâ€™s what we want to change.
Our mission is to build a unique space where people can communicate and collaborate in a completely safe and secure environment. Thatâ€™s why we will move on from mails and storage to voice, video and full range of communication and collaboration tools as soon as we could.
Who is running Just Mail? 
This project is coordinated by Eric Michel and Maria Hahn. They are brining it to life.They are building our team by searching people who are concerned about privacy and who are willing to work in spare time. We are very grateful to Windfall Systems Inc. and Vlad Repin CTO of Windfall Systems who helped us with test servers and supported the project by sharing his knowledge, skills and expirience in hardware field.
Our back-end part is being developed by two guys you have seen in a movie and their boss - Harley Puthuff. They all have more than 15 years of expirience in programming, C++, Python and have already participated in the building of a big mobile network from scratch.
Most recently Ivan Cherepukhin ( invited by Vladimir ) has joined the team - he designed our website, created our identity, draw a range of wonderful illustrations and now he is working on the design of our apps. Heâ€™s more than 10 years UX/UI expirience in best Moscow digital studios and has also launched a range of local startups designed by himself.
But for these people it wouldnâ€™t have been possible to do the first prototype of Just Mail:
Herve Andrieu and Serge Tsibulskiy are our engineers. Joseph Opare is our brave tester.
Geogre Foyht is helping Ivan with UI tasks and Tom Flux is converting their images into codes. And, of course, last but not least our traffic manager and a great girl Nazgul Kanatova. You can find our faces at Just Mail website.
and here is a bonus video from Ivan about NSA ( FBI ): 
ILARM is the first portable/wireless vehicle security system controlled and monitored by a smartphone app for both android and iphone.
All iLARM devices will be managed via a dashboard where you will have 24/7 assistance from us.
iLARM is not your typical car alarm or tracking/gps system. iLARM will alert you via smartphone notification of any incidents happening to your vehicle, for example: someone broke your car window, someone trying to steal your Rims and Tyres, someone hit your car, someone trying to tow  your car and so on.
Unlike those tracking/gps systems they will only alert you when the vehicle is already in motion after the theft had occurred and the old fashion car alarms, oh yeah and who pays attention to those annoying sounds.
 â€œOBDâ€ stands for â€œOn-Board Diagnosticsâ€, a network of small rugged computers that control everything in a modern vehicle, from engine and transmission, to anti-lock brakes and climate control. You are likely familiar with one element of the OBD system, the â€œCheck Engineâ€ light. Another element of the system, the OBD port, allows you to access the network for troubleshooting or other purposes.
 iLARM won't interfere with your legroom while driving, and fits in your pocket!
GSM module: FCC & PTCRB Certified
SIM Card Type: Standard 2G
Dimensions: 2.75 x 2.28 x 0.99 inches (70 x 58 x 25 mm)
Weight: 2.11 oz (60 g)
Operating Voltage: 8-18V DC
Operating Temperature: -4Âº to 131Âº F (-20Âº to 55Âº C)
Operating Humidity: 10 to 85% (non-condensing)
Officially supported platforms (this means, we verified that iLARM works with apps running under these operating systems) include:
iOS (iPhone, iPad)
Android phones & tablets
 Be warned if vehicle was hit while parked
 No body can Steal your Rims or Tyres
Be aware of glass breakage
 With 400 partners across 190+ countries, We will provide worldwide connectivity with unmatched depth of coverage to your iLARM devices.
You heard it around 12 Cents a Day
March: Finish debugging  firmware along with the Apps, final integration testing.
April: Order packaging & print documentation. Receive and test production samples. Begin production.
June: Package and ship the first production units.
  we expect to start shipping production units in end of May or Start of June.
 Itâ€™s been a long journey, but we are nearing the finish line: the prototypes are meeting our expectations, and as soon as the remaining GSM  glitches are fixed, we will be ready to begin production. All we need, is one last push. Your pledges will be used to cover the cost of manufacturing the first batch of iLARM devices.

Donâ€™t wait to make your pledge: we are practically giving away the first 100 units, and once theyâ€™re gone, theyâ€™re gone. Please support us by sharing this Kickstarter with your friends, and making a pledge, TODAY!
This is our working prototype, a scaled down version of this Projects Campaign
    Decades ago, I was looking into alternative energy sources that could compete with utility companies for providing electric. Back then, there were no tax incentives, nor were solar products even close to being reasonably priced. Today is a whole different and wonderful story! Solar products in general have came down in price nearly 50% over the past two years, promising affordable solar power to everybody who wants it. Also, Federal Tax incentives are at $3000 this year, and continue to improve as more alternative energy products are invented. These are just a few of the advantages of the "Cube" over conventional solar installed systems.
    Our "Cube" does not install onto your house, nor is it a permanent structure on your property. What does this mean to homeowners? NO new property taxes! Of course, if you decide to move, the whole system breaks down in under an hour to move with you! Wherever you go, the "Cube" system can go with you. These are a few of the advantages I wanted to see that the "Cube" has over the conventional solar installed systems.
To get started, we built the above pictured scaled down working prototype to prove the conceptual design and functionality of our main focus project, the "Cube". The current video we have is also only a working prototype, not the project we are trying to fund. The exterior dimensions will look similar to this first prototype, however the electrical components will be of the highest quality industry standards for solar system hardware with warranties starting at 5 years and extending up to 25 years on some parts, with lifetime warranties on workmanship and labor. Off the grid Cubes are a portable source of military tough secure electricity that will last decades, not just years. They are powered by high quality weatherproof and hail resistant photo voltaic solar panels which charge specialized high amp hour batteries, and produce clean energy for a wide span of electric needs. Ranging from a small campsite all the way up to a large industrial shop, depending on the number of modules used. They are very rugged, and meant to be transported in the back of a small trailer or pickup truck, and setup on site in under two hours. The "Cube" is built to be secure, with double concealed tamper resistant padlock construction in a heavy gauge steel weatherproof container. 
Prototype Cube solar / battery charging components
 The funds from all of our pledges to build the full scale "Cube" will be used to purchase high quality solar power components, such as a 6kw power inverter, several 300 watt photo-voltaic solar panels, charge controller, auto generator start module, heavy steel casing for the components, several high amp hour deep cycle batteries, acoustic sound proofing foam for the generator section, rubber padding for the base of the container, weatherstripping, lighting for the interior of container, steel for fabricating the frame for the solar panels, heavy copper cabling for the battery connections, copper cable ends, 2kw electric start backup generator, heavy casters to roll the container around on, camo paint pattern stencils, paint, and a breaker box to protect the charging system from short failures.
Photovoltaic solar panels
 I am consulting with a 30 year experience new product engineer, and good friend, Mike Lawless. He provides tons of great ideas and information critical to the success of this project. I will be building this project in my 50x60 shop in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.

This is a project to create a reliable, secure, and free crowdfilming platform that can be used to shoot videos in places that can not be reached by professional filming crews.
Our team: 
We are a team of professionals with backgrounds ranging form hardware and software engineering to international law and human rights. Our experience includes creating and supporting security systems for a number of Fortune 500 companies as well as governments around the world. Members of our team speak Arabic, traveled to the Middle East on multiple occasions, lived there, and participated in recent uprisings. For this specific project we have joined forces with a network of over 500 civil journalists in Syria, Egypt, and Bahrain who will act as a core of our filming crew as well as help us distribute the cameras on the streets. We have also found a few independent filmmakers to help us process gathered footage and put it together into a documentary.

The Hiding Duck Project:

With money raised on Kickstarter we are planning to fund the scaling up of our infrastructure. We will transform our test proxy server into a cloud server farm to be able to handle at least 50 simultaneous video uploads. We have already talked to a factory in China that tested our camera prototype and gave us a lead time of 5 days for manufacturing of 1000 cameras. Manufactured cameras will be sent into one of a number of ongoing conflict zones in the Middle East. We are in touch with multiple human rights organizations that provide support for human rights activists in Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, and elsewhere that will help us deliver the cameras. Director pledgers will be invited to help us make decisions on distributing cameras to specific regions. Over the next few months we will support our proxy server infrastructure, gather recorded footage, and create a first-of-its-kind documentary filmed by hundreds of people, The Hiding Duck.

As soon as the project is complete, we will make the technology available for people who are interested in creating their own crowdfilm. They will be able to purchase secure cameras as well as have access to the decoding software to securely upload videos.
Technical Details
Cameras:
Each camera has been uploaded with custom firmware that prevents unauthorized access to recorded videos. The firmware uses a modified file system to store videos on a MicroSD card. As a measure of personal security, and in order to avoid breaking any importing/exporting laws on encryption technologies, no actual encryption is used. However, unless a key file or our decoding software is used, the card appears to be empty. Additionally there is an option to upload a dummy video to the visible portion of the memory card to divert attention. To anyone unfamiliar with the hidden functionality of the camera, it seems to be broken.
Footage recovery:
There are two ways to get the footage from the camera. In the first scenario, the file containing the decryption code needs to be copied over to the camera connected via USB. After reconnecting the USB cable, the camera sees the code and unlocks its main storage. In situations when the user doesn't have a code, he can download special decoding software from our website.
Decoding/uploading software:
The software knows the algorithm being used to record videos and doesn't need a key to recover them. Users have an option of uploading videos to our private YouTube channel or their own YouTube account. This way, the only way to recover videos is either to have a code or upload it on YouTube. In both cases we get links to uploaded videos. In situations when YouTube is blocked (ex. Syria) the software uses cloud based proxy servers that we set up. The videos uploaded under our account will remain unlisted until further approval. Our moderators can view and edit them, apply image stabilization, etc, all using YouTube processing power. When approved and edited, the videos are made public. We can also block uploading footage from any given camera based on its serial number if it is using our resources for irrelevant footage. Users can also securely wipe out a camera's memory after uploading their videos.
FAQs
Wouldn't people just steal the cameras?

The camera itself has no value. As we are not planning to share access codes with people we don't trust, the only way to recover the footage for them is to use our decoding software and upload it to YouTube. We can also block decoding based on the serial number of the camera if we see that it is being used for irrelevant footage. Besides, even if only 1 out 10 cameras gets in the right hands, we would still have at least 100 cameras providing us with unique video material.
Doesn't everyone have a smartphone by now?
It's definitely not the case for the regions torn apart by a civil war. With most of the conflicts come cellular network outage, Internet shutdowns, and heavy censorship. Most of the people who are able to buy an iPhone flee the region well before it gets ugly around their house. Those who stay and have the knowledge and resources to keep an Internet connection up and circumvent government filtering systems, find it hard to hold a smartphone while being shot at.
Why get in all this trouble with James-Bond kind of security?
We take physical security of people who are filming very seriously. Not only are people with cameras targeted for physical violence, but attempts to destroy footage are frequent. Through deleting files on the camera, hacking into user accounts, and creating false web pages to post videos â€“ there is a constant cat-and-mouse game to release new footage to the world.  
What are the technical details of the camera?
Each camera can record 1-2 hours of 480p footage on a single charge splitting it in 10-minute videos and overwriting old files if the memory card is full. The camera supports up to 16gb MicroSDHC cards.

What is nimbusID? nimbusID is a start-up solving one of the biggest challenges in Internet security. It implements a patented software system for the creation and authentication of True Digital ID without using a password.
Why do we need nimbusID? The average user has 10 or more online accounts and is frequently required to change his/her passwords. The difficulty and inconvenience of having to memorize multiple passwords is simply overwhelming.  Password insecurity continues to be exploited by hackers leading to data theft and fraud. Since the password is the main problem, why not just eliminate the concept of using a password? To achieve this, nimbusID uses the power of your mind to securely authenticate your digital identity and require dynamic server-initiated queries for all authentications. By allowing the mind to be utilized as the key to each authentication attempt, effective verification and True ID Digital Authentication can occur. nimbusID provides the highest level of security without increasing inconvenience.
Take back your identity with nimbusID.  Your brain is the most advanced technology known to man. At the age of three, the brain has a trillion neural connections. nimbusID uses those trillions of thought patterns in your mind to verify and authenticate your identity, relying on you to recognize an object, associate its unique attributes, and interpret its meaning. No password or static credential is stored in any device.
How does it work? During registration, a user recalls a unique life experience that will be used to populate empty fields as seen in the demo. For example: â€œJulie Gomez is my first girlfriend when I was a senior student at Dallas High School in 1975, she gave me a pen as my graduation gift and later on became a professional golferâ€.
User Registration:
The information provided will be stored in the data base server, to be later used during each authentication process. Our proprietary data storage design makes data information, when hacked meaningless to anyone. Using this method, claim validation and human authentication can proceed regardless of the computing device used.
Signing in to nimbusID is simple and intuitive: As shown in demo below, a list of objects will be presented, one of which is your unique focus object known and is recognized by you alone. Successive columns will drop with list of attributes, one of which you will select for its association with the focus object. Columns appear one at a time to prevent related data from exposure at any one time, adding to your security. After you click the correct object and attributes, your identity is verified and securely authenticated. Want to try it out?  go to http://www.nimbusid.com/auth_simulator (click the logo, type your name, then hit enter, click First kiss, Lubbock, and Golfer to be successfully authenticated).
Example of screen login:
This system allows us to create authentication using your own brain (mind) as the key, hence the (static) password is eliminated. Future log-in is dynamic and unique at any given time rendering "phishing" attacks virtually obsolete. Because your strings are made of objects and attributes that are implied to the user, sign-on is instant, all without memorizing a password or asking a single security question. Furthermore, since you just "click or tap" vs. input text on a keyboard, the process is quicker and less prone to keystroke input errors. Sound easier than remembering a password? We thought so.
How can nimbusID provide True Digital ID identification and authentication? The objects that are displayed and the order they are placed on the screen are different for each authentication attempt. The values that are selected, as well as the pattern in which they are presented, are unique each time the user attempts to authenticate. Thus, brute force hacking and phishing are virtually eliminated. It is highly improbable to successfully apply brute force (trying different combinations against a static value until via process of elimination the correct sequence is discovered) against a constantly changing value. The same applies for phishing â€“ a user cannot be tricked into providing a password (or any static key) to a hacker when the key is different for every authentication attempt and there being no way to know what key will be requested, as that is randomly and dynamically decided by the server (known as server to user query) only at the time that the authentication is initiated.
nimbusID authorization and authentication:  A stolen credit card that is nimbusID enabled may have been breached  but no financial loss occur through fraudulent transaction both for the user and the issuing financial institution.  The hacker who stole the credit card information can not initiate any transaction because the hacker needs to be authorized to transact and the authorization needs to be authenticated through nimbusID.  Our patented technology software's ability to simultaneously provide authentication and authenticate the authorization is a powerful tool against current digital exploits.
nimbusID is highly secure and convenient: nimbusID uses non-sensitive data, or strings, for quick authentication. Input several strings when signing up, and then update the strings periodically to keep them fresh. Even better, nimbusID recycles the strings to create noise data for other users, making the system more secure for everyone as the data pool grows. In short:
- Your strings donâ€™t contain sensitive information
- You recognize your strings instantly no matter how many you create
- Your strings are always relevant to your unique life experiences
- The more strings you add, the more secure you and other users are
Why is nimbuID's solution the best? Other innovative solutions to improve the security of the current password system have failed. Our solution is to eliminate the concept of passwords and replace it with a new architecture, nimbusID. This new paradigm:
Â·Works with your natural thought pattern (a security key that travels with you, inside your mind)
Â·Virtually eliminates typical forms of hacking, such as phishing or brute force attacks
Â·No need to memorize passwords
With nimbusID you get:
- Identity verification plus True Digital ID Authentication
- Reduce FAD (fear, anxiety, and doubt) about online transactions
- Increase security and convenience at the same time
Eliminate my passwords while increasing my security and efficiency? Neat! What does nimbusID mean for the future? nimbusIDâ€™s innovative design may lead to:
- A unified, user-centric, personalized gateway to access all of your online accounts
- Internet access to all of your online accounts, 24/7,  anywhere, anytime, any device
- Faster and more efficient online activity
- Confidence in your privacy and security
- Enriched user experience and efficient consumer/provider connection
- One-stop secure checkout with simple documentation of transaction
- Safer global e-commerce and decreased fraudulent transaction
Why crowd funding? Our team has spent almost two years developing the working prototypes for nimbusID.  Now we need your participation to get to the next level.  We can greatly diminish the risk of being hacked or phished, and allow you to surf the web securely and safely if we have enough momentum. So far, we have built a proof of concept, conducted a security analysis and engaged in limited beta testing. In order to make nimbusID a reality, we need to:
- Hire software specialists to design, develop, and complete the software
- Integrate with multi-platform devices and add other functionality
- Build and host the newest versions of the software
- Deploy the software to the mainstream market
One you, one nimbusID.  Only you can help replace the traditional log-in method once and for all. You only need one global identity for the World Wide Web. Are you ready for password-free access to all your online accounts? We can make it happen with nimbusID.
MiFlight was created to answer a significant question all travelers face - how long is the security line at the airport?
We have a beautiful and simple solution for you. MiFlight will tell you the last logged time at the security checkpoint nearest your gate so you can plan ahead. Help your fellow traveler by being part of the community.
Check. Plan. Be in the know. Relax.
After a year of hard work and dedication, we launched our first version in early 2014, with small updates along way. We currently offer 50+ of the world's busiest airports, including terminal maps and the ability to share with everyone in your social network.
With your help, we will begin building the next version of MiFlight. We'll be adding to our already awesome team by expanding our development and design team.
There are over 49,000 airports in the world, and we plan to add many many more than the 50 we have today. While it might not be a whopping 49,000, we'll definitely be adding the ones you travel the most. When we reach our stretch goals, we'll be building for Android and building in some really clever automation with ways to help predict times, ultimately saving you and the world time.
The timeline below is what we'll be working on over the next five months. The future for MiFlight is out of this world, and you gotta take this journey with us! 
If we reach our initial goal of $100,000, we will remove in-app purchases, giving you all the maps and information for FREE!
 Reaching a stretch goal of $125,000, we'll make this app available on Android. We will also add an additional 100 airports and terminal maps.
With a stretch goal of $150,000, we'll build the app for tablets.
If we make a whopping goal of $200,000, we'll create a version for your laptop/desktop. Sometimes it's easier to just check your laptop/desktop especially if you're charging your phone. You know who you are :)
 This one is phenomenal--meeting a $300,000 stretch goal means we'll take our technology to the whole world of waiting in lines. The possibilities are endless, and we're ready to save the world time!
 Our unique and great team consists of designers, engineers, product managers and artists with many years of enterprise and start up experience. 
The Problem
Over the years, many of us have collected computers in our garages, basements, and attics. While many of us know that recycling old computers is the environmentally responsible thing to do, we also know doing so could provide identity thieves with the financial documents, medical records, personal correspondence, and other sensitive data stored on the hard drives in these computers. The damage an identity thief could do with this information is terrifying, so, for many of us, these computers continue to collect dust in our homes.
If you put your old computer in the trash or take it to most electronics recyclers, you don't know where it is going, who is going to handle it, or what the recycler is going to do with it. There are many horror stories of individuals relying on municipal recycling or companies relying on corporate recyclers to responsibly dispose of their computers, only to find out later that their hard drives had been resold un-erased.
When you take your computer to a big box chain to be recycled, the safety of your data isn't guaranteed, either. You must read all of the fine print. Many big box chains take no responsibility for your data on your hard drive.
Our Secure, Reliable, and Verifiable Solution
The Secure Shell is a plastic shipping container and destruction service designed to provide you with the most secure, reliable, and verifiable method of destroying your sensitive electronic data available today.
Exploded rendering of the Secure Shell. Every part of the Secure Shell is 100% recyclable.
The Secure Shell
The Secure Shell is a hard plastic container specifically designed for you to send a hard drive, cell phone, or other small electronic data containing devices to our secure facility for destruction. 
Image from US Patent Application 61/621,729 "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR SECURE DISPOSAL OF AN ARTICLE"
CAD of the Secure Shell
Sample Secure Shell from the first pre-production batch
One of the unique aspects of the Secure Shell is the design of the corner locking mechanisms that cannot be reopened without showing obvious signs of tampering. Therefore, you can rest assured that once you have securely locked your hard drive, cell phone, or other electronic data containing device into a Secure Shell, no one will ever touch it again. Your closed Secure Shell and its contents are reduced to 3/4" in size by a hammer-mill and mixed with the remains of hundreds of other Secure Shells. These output residuals will be stored under lock and key in our secure facility until we ship them out to an eco-friendly recycler.
3D prototype of the Secure Shell corner locking mechanism
Closeup of corner locking mechanism from the first pre-production batch of Secure Shells
This is the hammer-mill installed in our facility. It will reduce Secure Shells and the devices contained within to less than 3/4" in size.
The Process
Every Secure Shell shipped has a unique Customer Identification Label (CIL) affixed to it. Each CIL contains three unique sets of data that we use to keep track of every Secure Shell that is shipped to a customer, returned by a customer, and destroyed in our facility.
Progression of CIL from concept to final design.
Before mailing us your Secure Shell, you will register it on our website using the information printed on the CIL. Once we receive your Secure Shell, we use the CIL to relate it to your account, to tell you when your Secure Shell will be destroyed and to send you a video clip of your Secure Shell's destruction. You will also receive a Certificate of Destruction for your Secure Shell. 
Our process and the software needed to support it are unique to the data destruction industry.
Each Secure Shell comes with a pre-paid Fed-Ex return envelope, instructions, and a unique and easily recognizable CIL.
Our entire process is designed to give you the peace of mind youâ€™ll get by knowing that the sensitive electronic data on your old hard drives, cell phones and other devices has been destroyed. 
You can rest assured that
Your Secure Shell and the device(s) you put in it will be destroyed. We do not overwrite, erase, refurbish or resell any devices.
Your Secure Shell will be destroyed in our secure facility. We do not use third parties to destroy your data.
Your Secure Shell will be destroyed by people who specialize in data destruction full time, not by people working in a large recycling plant who focus primarily on other tasks.
Access to our facility is tightly controlled and the facility is under constant video surveillance.
Your Secure Shell will be destroyed promptly upon receipt. All devices in our possession are locked in a secure cage with limited access as soon as they are received and logged. 
Your device will be shredded to meet or exceed the NIST 800-88 standards for data destruction.
The material produced from the destruction of thousands of hard drives is mixed together and is recycled by nationally recognized recyclers that meet stringent environmental standards. This keeps potentially hazardous materials out of our landfills and the recovered metals are reused.
Our Production Schedule
Why we need your help
The founders have designed the Secure Shell and written supporting software without reimbursement. Our injection molder is building the molds to manufacture the parts in the U.S.A.. However, due to manufacturer requirements we need to order a minimum of 2000 units. We will be able to start manufacturing at the end of a successful Kickstarter campaign. This is why we need your help so we can provide people like you with a secure, reliable, and verifiable means to destroy your personal electronic data.

latch n load with sheetrock
The story of latch n load
For many years I have come up with several ideas for products that would make things easier for me and this happens to be one of the( light bulb goes off in the head times) so I knew I had to make this idea come to life so hereâ€™s the story of the Latch N Load.
So the Latch N Load started one day in the middle of Feb 2015 a friend brought his truck in my shop with a problem and while we were fixing his truck we were talking about ideas on how to find a solution to tying things down to the back of the pickup with the tailgate in the open position, thatâ€™s when it hit me what if I made a tool that was able to become latched in the existing latches of the tailgate and had adjustable tying hooks mounted on the tool (wow! how cool would that be) so the idea of the latch n load was born. My son Dalton and I got started right away with the prototype which took me three days to make, first the drawings, then checking on patent infringement which there werenâ€™t any, nothing even close! So I filed the provisional patent on 4/1/2015 thatâ€™s right April Foolâ€™s day, Then not to long after I filed the utility patent.
Then Dalton and I got to work on the machining right away and ended up with one of many designs resulting in seven different sizes.
I even had to build my own machines to make the tool because I couldnâ€™t find anyone that could make it for me at a reasonable cost so here is the pictures of the bar slicer and the end plate rotator I made.
the money maker in automated action
The slicing table I built ( Named the Money Maker ) I had a close friend of mine do the electronics, thanks Carl Ryles . The endplate rotator was constructed with an old wiper motor and other parts from a car and a battery and switches from the local hardware. After many sleepless nights and long hours while still keeping our other business running (jetski rental and repair) we somehow came up with our final end result.
built to last
Since the start we have also come up with a few attachment ideas for the tool which turned a tool with limited uses to a tool with unlimited uses like how to load a atv, motor cycle, utv and or snowmobile without the loading ramps coming off the pickup tailgate while loading, 
heavy rhino with no problem
Then a friend came in that had seen our idea come to life and said that we needed to help support the tailgate from the chincey straps from braking. My son made these fully adjustable strap supports and they tested with amazing results. Now the tailgate can handle a lot more weight without any damage. (also shown in the pic above)
After we found the right design and lots of testing we decided to try it out in the real settings so we made about 100 latch n load tools and a few of the accessories. We took a few to SEMA 2015 the largest aftermarket show in the USA for market testing.( SEMA is a no sale show just show your product and get interested buyers). We setup a display and man did we knock it out of the park with many great responses like I gotta have it and where can we buy it. We even had many buyers from corperations wanting to add it to there lineup. Did I mention we were asked to do a comercial for performance tv that it would air the week before the SEMA show because the producer thought we had a great product idea and found out about us from our registration with the SEMA show ( Hell Ya we did). we also went to our local Home Depot stores  Dec 19th and gave a few to unsuspecting people. "what a hit"   
After reading Lori Greiner's book and watching endless Shark Tank Shows (my wife now Hates) I think I have all the bases covered from patent to testing, quality product, packaging, and cost. 
We feel that we are ready to get the Latch n Load launched! and need your help to get it there with the right tooling and materials to build this quality tool and accessories at an affordable price for the end user so please pledge and share with your friends to help us get the word out and watch this grow to endless heights. We have many great rewards to offer and they will be for a limited time so donâ€™t miss out on your very own first batch of the Latch N Load tool and thank you so very much for reading all about our journey with the Latch N Load. We would love to have you a part of our team.

Why Create the Mode Mount? 
With the introduction of Appleâ€™s newly redesigned Mac Pro, consumers are left wondering how to â€œdeal withâ€ the new iconic design. Where would it go? How can it be stored as a server? How do I place it with other equipment in a workstation?
The new design of the Mac Pro is sleek and streamline. However it does not attach securely onto a server rack system. This poses a problem for professional consumers. When speaking with photographers, video production companies, audio mobile and post houses, both remote and studio-based, the concern was the same across board: 
The new Mac Pro does not mount into the racks professionals currently use for their equipment.
 What is the Mode Mount? 
A premium quality tool for the professional, the Mode Mount provides a stable, easy to use system for mounting the New Apple Mac Pro onto any industrial rack. This system will support the Mac Pro tower, protecting the valuable equipment and attaching it securely to your professional server rack. Our product will add function and utilize the enhanced form factor that Apple has developed with the Mac Pro. 
Mode Mount Horizontal creates maximized space flow, allowing you to rack two Mac Pros in a 4u space. In a January memo, Apple confirmed that "although the Mac Pro is designed to operate in an upright position, you can also use it on its side."
Mode Mount Desk lets you mount the Mac Pro securely below your desk. 
Mode Mount Vertical allows for the Mac Pro to be installed onto the back or front of your racking system. This mount is designed for stationary server racks only. We don't recommend it for mobile cases/racks. If you're looking to rack mount on a mobile case or rack, Mode Mount Horizontal is more stable as it connects to the back and front of the rack. 
The Design...
PLAY

 Compliments the clean and uncomplicated design of the Mac Pro. 
The thin bands of the Mode Mount showcase the Mac Pro design as much as possible without losing stability. The Mode Mount is also made from aluminum, giving it the look and feel of an Apple product. 
Maximizes airflow.
The Mode Mount securely locks the Mac Pro into place without obstructing the base of the computer. 
Securely holds the Mac Pro in place. 
Functioning much like a bike post clamp, the Mount clamps around the tube to hold it in place. The Mode Mount also includes a bottom tab and an upper, retainer tab to add additional safety for mobile units. These rings will also have a coated interior to minimize any scratching or damage to the Mac Pro. A protective gasket between the Mac Pro and the Mode Mount will further minimize damage by helping with vibration and scratching. 
Allows easy access to the multiple port connections. 
How is it made? 
PLAY

  Our process is purposeful with minimal amounts of materials. Inspired by Appleâ€™s design philosophy, the Mode Mount was created with high quality precision. Every piece is extruded from premium grade aluminum. The stunning design is then placed into an aluminum-anodized process, revealing a product of not only high value but integrity. 
Timeline 
The design work for the Mode Mount is already completed. Weâ€™ve also already had estimates made for the tooling and machining costs. Once funded, the money will be used to pay for the tooling set-up, manufacturing and packaging costs. We estimate that it will take approximately 3.5 months after getting funded to ship out our first round of 600 Mode Mounts. Our goal is to have the first shipment out by September 2014. If we exceed the amount needed for our project and it seems there is an influx of interest, we plan to open up the product offering and do a second round of deliverables to be shipped at a later date.

What Is Piggybank
The Piggybank Card
Piggybank (http://getpiggybank.com) is a brand new take on chores and allowance. With Piggybank you can assign your kids chores with a dollar amount attached to it and as they complete their chores you'll be notified. If you approve of their handy work we'll add the value of that chore to their balance and at an interval you specify, such as every 30 days, we'll send your kid a Piggybank Visa Card with the money they've earned from their chores. They will be able to use it anywhere Visa is accepted. You can also attach photos, videos, and comments to chores so you can help your kids complete their tasks from anywhere.
Why We Made It
Oscar and Adam working
We, Oscar and Adam, are both fathers and computer engineers. Oscar has experience in the financial industry working for Simple, a bank, as an engineer as well. With our knowledge, we knew we could take the old clunky method of allowance and chores and streamline it to make it something kids actually wanted to do. No more running to the ATMs, chore wheels, schedules, spreadsheets, or any of that. It's all in one app on your phone and the money is all handled by us.
Every product out there now uses fake money, "digital stickers" and internet points. This doesn't teach children about handling money like handling real money does. This app is just the first step. We want to grow Piggybank into a full suite of tools and teaching materials for children to learn about financial responsibility.
Why We Need Your Help
Currently Piggybank has just two engineers (Adam and Oscar) and Jakob helping with marketing and business stuff. The three of us alone are working on the design, marketing, mobile web app, web site, and more, but we just don't know native mobile app development well enough to build that part out ourselves. We want to hire people who have experience building native mobile apps so we can give the best possible experience to our users and we want to do this in unison with our web launch. This way when Piggybank goes live to everyone they can use the app in whatever way they enjoy the most.
What the funds will go towards
Software projects are not cheap and because we're integrating with a bank the time and complexity of building the app increases. We have to spend a lot more time on security for one and there's a lot of back and forth with our bank partners. The steps to build a native mobile app usually consist of:
Design
Code
Testing (QA)
Infrastructure (getting our servers to handle the mobile app traffic)
Getting the app approved by 3rd parties such as the bank and Apple. 
After all of that we will need to keep the mobile developers around so they can fix any bugs that may not have been caught in the testing stage for awhile. We expect this whole process to take anywhere from three to six months.

Rewards
Swag Packs
Swag Packs contain an assortment of shirts and stickers. Depending on your contribution amount you'll get one of three types of Swag Packs. The shirts in the swag packs can come in white or black and then men's, women's, or children's. 
Swag Pack: 1 shirt, 3 stickers
Super Swag Pack: 3 shirts, 5 stickers
Ultimate Swag Pack: 5 shirts, a handful of stickers
Beta Access
Beta access will be provided first come first serve based on when you backed us. Kickstarter contributors get access before anyone else outside Kickstarter as well. In other words, someone who signed up on our site has a much lower chance of getting an invite before someone who was an early Kickstarter backer.
Depending on when you get a beta invite, it may be before cards are ready. You'll still be able to sign add family members, assign chores, and use all the other functionality until the cards can be shipped out.
Piggybank Yammer Community
The Piggybank Yammer Community will be a private online community for people who donated $25 or more to our Kickstarter. It will give you early access to screenshots and ideas from us. We plan on pitching concepts to this community to get early feedback. Once the native apps are out, and even when the beta is over, we are planning to keep the community open to keep the feedback cycle going for early concepts and designs.
Thanks to Edward Snowden there is proof, the NSA is spying on everybody. We can't just expect privacy anymore. We must take steps to protect ourselves and our privacy rights.
This is the new reality living in today's world. If you don't take extreme steps to protect your privacy, then you, according to the government; Have no reasonable expectation of privacy. While there are certainly solutions that already exist that attempt to protect your privacy. The vast majority of them are hosted environments. They require you to trust that their servers are safe, and not being used for the purpose of marketing or spying.
We have chosen; hopefully with your help, to build a highly flexible secure environment that can support both a hosted platform as well as an end to end platform. The beauty of our environment is that it's built entirely on top of the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol. This means rather than trusting that our server's are secure and not being monitored. You can choose which server you want to trust, or even setup your own!
Additionally, unlike previous open source solutions. This will not be a â€œside projectâ€. We will be dedicated to responding quickly to holes in the system as they appear. We will also be actively testing the system to find holes before unsavory groups do.
HOW IT WORKS
You will have three choices for local authentication of the application. This is done to help protect your privacy while you might be other wise away. Additionally, when the application detects you are â€œidleâ€, It will lock.
Your local authentication choices are as follows:
4 â€“ 12 digit numeric key code
4 â€“ 12 digit image selection code (50 randomized source images)
5 â€“ 32 character symbolized alphanumeric (must contain 1 symbol, letter & number) password
A 256 byte key is securely randomized by you to represent your friends when you add them to your contact list. During your first conversation and subsequently once per N days (or 4 â€“ 12 digit image selection code (50 randomized source images)on demand) the keys are re-generated and exchanged. These key exchanges are protected with Authenticated Double-AES-CTR256 and a Diffie-Hellman equation using 2048 bit prime numbers. When you send a message to your friend, that message is protected with Authenticated Double-AES-CTR256 and a combination of your keys forming a 512 byte key which is then subsequently hashed with Salted PKCS12 & SHA512. Further more each message includes source, destination & time authentication. Lastly the overlaying protocol being used is flexible enough to rotate encryption methods & strength seamlessly as holes may be presented over time.
Note: While running in Windows Vista and above. All screens in the application will be treated as â€œlayered windowsâ€. This for example, will allow the application to be used on a Live Stream without any risk of it being seen by the stream viewers. This also provides a small level of protection from screen capturing programs not specifically designed to capture layered windows.

ADD-ONS
Add-ons, are modules of code that are designed to fill a specific purpose in the communication world. They will allow TalkNPrivate to be used beyond the confines of the IRC protocol. While it's true both parties wishing to communicate would still need to be on an IRC network to send and receive message ciphers. They are not required to â€œidleâ€ on said network. Meaning a user's â€œonlineâ€ or â€œofflineâ€ status could be determined using a remote service, rather than there ability to remain connected to a IRC server. This will be most useful for users on a mobile phone or tablet using a cellular network. While also helping users who suffer from unstable internet.

The initial round of Add-Ons from nPrivate will include: 
Group Chat
Facebook (Online / Offline status only)
Twitter (Online / Offline status only)
Google Plus (Online / Offline status only)
Linked In (Online / Offline status only)
vBulletin (Online / Offline status only)
PhpBB (Online / Offline status only)
Text-to-Speech
Speech-to-Tex
Voice over IRC communication
However it's important to note! The Add-On system is extremely flexible, allowing TalkNPrivate to stay current and AWESOME for years to come.
THEMES
The applicationâ€™s user interface as well as application programming interface is being designed in HTML 5 & JavaScript. This allows it to support a fully customizable layout. This will allow the theme author to control how information is displayed on the screen. Themes will be packaged and installed on the nPrivate community market place.
EMBEDDED CLIENT
A C# dynamic library will be created with no add'on support. It will be used to include a secure messaging environment into existing .NET applications. This library will be free for personal use. Commercial use must be licensed with nPrivate. Additional languages may be included. However it is important to note that .NET is the only language we can commit to supporting at this time.
OPEN SOURCE
The application's core structure will be released in a "read-only" format. You will be free to fork the code for personal or educational purposes. Commercial use MUST BE licensed with nPrivate. We will not accept submitted code without first verifying the code is not tainted. We do not provide a time frame in which code will be verified. I realize this in part is not inline with the open philosophy. This is because Edward Snowden & NSA have proven we can't have nice things anymore.
Source code for Add-On's & Themes will also be released. However, it's important to note that you will not be able to compile either of them for use in the application. Both Add-On's and Themes are required to undergo very strict standards of validation. They will only be installed, updated & validated from the nPrivate network servers.
Gibson is a prototype of software that allows you to build a model of your network, via a network scan, dynamically, or programmatically, in a three dimensional space.  It then takes input from logging tools or intrusion detection systems and displays them as objects which interact with the model.  For example, if an intrusion detection system noticed a computer being attacked, you would see an object ("slug") move from outside of the system toward that computer.  You can click on the computer to get more information on it, or click on the slug to see details of the event / attack.
Gibson includes many visual cues to help you take in a lot of information quickly.  The three dimensions of the space are used to organize your network devices and services according to three variables.  The colors, shapes, time and direction also give cues as to what is happening.  This allows monitoring personnel or nontechnical observers to get a quick feel for the scope of problems.
As a fully featured interactive 3D model, Gibson includes controls for zooming, rotating, and panning, as well as searching and a variety of shortcuts.  There are numerous different views and zoom levels, from a macro view of your entire network to a detailed view of a single server.
The prototype works well, but in order to develop it in to a production ready, enterprise grade application, a lot more work needs to be done.  Our biggest obstacle is that it is difficult to replicate the traffic from a large enterprise or busy network, so our datasets have been relatively small to date.

How it works  
Once the illumin-Aid Smartswitch is installed and the controller is positioned near the alarm siren:
Whenever the alarm siren is activated, the controller sends a wireless signal to the switch or switches to change their status to "alarm mode."
In alarm mode, the switch flashes any light connected to the switch in an S.O.S. pattern.  While in alarm mode, for security reasons, the alarm mode can not be deactivated by flipping the toggle switch.  It can only be deactivated by the remote control provided in the kit.
To determine which package best fits your needs, predetermine how many Illumin-Aid Smartswitches that you need.  Illumin-Aid is EXPANDABLE!

 What is an I-FOB ?
An I-FOB is a Bluetooth Device that resembles a car remote.This device Pairs with Your Bluetooth Smart Phone or Tablet.
Watch The Video to see just a few of the applications.
How does the I-FOB work?
The I-FOB receives a wireless signal from your smart phone device. Once it receives this signal it sends it back to your smart phone. This is how the communication is completed. If for some reason this communication is interrupted then the alarm and Flashing Light features are activated.
How Far can the I-FOB be away from the Phone?
We currently can go 50-75 feet at this time. We need additional funding to continue our Research and Development and to complete our App. Program.
We are hopeful to extend our range to over 100 feet.
How does the I-FOB find my Phone?
Part of our App. Is giving the I-FOB the ability to communicate with the smart phone or tablet with BLUETOOTH Technlogy. If you press the Locate Button on the I-FOB you are interrupting the Bluetooth signal. This Interruption Activates the Alarm on your smart device to sound.
You can also Press the Locate button on Your Smart device to activate your I-FOB to sound, identifying its location by a Chirping sound.
 How does the I-FOB AUTOMATICALLY KEEP ME FROM LOSING MY PHONE?
When you keep the I-FOB on your person it will automatically sound which alerts you that you have walked out of range of your smart device.
How loud is the I-FOB?
The I-FOB can be set to a discreet chirp, a loud siren or just vibrate with flashing lights. We recognize that false alarms are may  to happen.Our pramming will allow us to activate the I-FOB in a progressive manner slowly getting louder and louder.This way is you accidently go out of range you will be notified in not such an alarmimg manner. This is also some of the final  R+D we will be developing with the Funding From KICKSTARTER.COM
What will the Funding be used for?
We  need additional funding to further develop the Research and Design that will extend our Bluetooth signal and to finilize the APP. Program. 
What does the APP. do?
Our App. Will allow you to chose several diffrent sounds that you can associate with your diffrent I-FOB devices. For example If you have an I-FOB on your Purse you can chose an a sound clip that will play on your phone that will sound if the I-FOB has extended past the range you have also programmed.This sound could be a Cash register chime,a siren or ?
As another example, you can Put an I-FOB on your Child at the shopping mall. You can select that if the range of 25 feet is broken your Phone will sound extremely loud and so will the I-FOB. Better safe than sorry.
Can I use the I-FOB at the same time I am using Other Blue Tooth Devices?
Yes. The I-FOB can be used at the same time as your other BLUETOOTH  devices. You can also run several I-FOBS at the Same time. Lets say you have 3 children.
You can give each child an I-FOB and Recognize each Individually on your smart device!
Lets say your traveling you can put an I-FOB in your handbag, your suitcase and your briefcase. Keep track of all 3 at the same time. 
Can I program the I-FOB to disarm from my Phone.
Yes. If The I-FOB is in range you can go to our App. Chose that particular I-FOB and disarm as needed.
What are all the Diffrent Rewards offered?
The I-FOB is one single unit. It can simply be placed in your pocket or you can chose one of the several diffrent types of attachments. The I-FOB can attach to several diffrent clips,snaps,chains or straps. 
What is the Ultimate Goal for the I-FOB?
Our Goal is to develop and Market the I-FOB as a way to keep track of multiple items and to offer accessories that are very unique and fashionalble.
  When will I receive my I-FOB?
First of all please note your card will not be Charged unless funding goal has been met. Once the Goal has been met on the specific Date then your card will be charged. Kickstarted will hold those funds for 2 weeks. Our plan is to see that the project appears to be successful and take the gamble that it will be funded and start R+D at that time. We anticipate that the I-FOBS will ship to you In February 2112.
Thank you for all these questions!
 Please help spread the word on Facebook and Twitter.
Here are a few Illustrations.
The time spent buying a new phone, going without a phone, not to mention the time spent reloading music, pictures and all those phone numbers and e-mail addresses is overwhelming. What about your personal information, your identity? Most of us keep a great deal of personal and private information on our phones these days. What value do you place on that? Spend $40.00. The first time you misplace your phone and quickly recover it, the I-FOB has paid for itself.
The I-FOB operates on a wireless signal. If this signal is extended above a certain range this causes not only the I-FOB to CHIRP and alert the owner, but also sets off a very loud alarm at the phone itself. 
Below you will see a variety of available accessories to allow you to use this wonderful device the way YOU want to. 
Any would be crook will toss your phone and run.
Another way to use this I-FOB is simply keep it in your possesion at all times. Clip it to your hat, wear it as a necklace, put it in your pocket. 
It for some reason you walk away from your phone it will alert you ! 
Also , how many times have you misplaced your phone? Looking and looking for hours. Now you can just press our FIND button on the I-FOB and you will hear where your Phone has Hidden!
Place the I-FOB on items like that new leather jacket you just handed to the coat check. Place it in your gym bag or suitcase. Leave it in your purse so you know if it is being stolen!  Leave it on your bicycle while you're at the park.
Do your kids tend to run out of sight? No more! They will set off an alarm telling you they have ventured too far away. Plus The I-FOB is ON them Chirping at the same time. The I-FOB signal works in both directions, to the I-FOB and back to your phone. Place an I-FOB on any valuable item and keep track of it with your phone.
Thousand of other uses. Please support this product.
One more thing I failed to mention; If for some reason the person still gets away with your phone we can still disable the ability for anyone to reuse it as a phone again. Our APP. will record your phone's special ID and notify service carriers it  is unusable.
 CLICK THAT LIKE BUTTON !   That is FREE and Helps spread the word.
      Help us stop PRISM tracking you and your followers through their cell phones.

Who is behind Rapp It Up?
Rapp It Up concept was born late in 2012. The problem that I was concerned with was that I knew that my wireless carrier was using my lifeâ€™s information (my data) to make money and that didnâ€™t sit well with me. I pay a large amount of cash to this mutli-national giant and they are making money on the side by selling my information to anyone. I decided right then that that situation was extremely distasteful to me and that I had to do something about it. 
The manufacturing plan started and the design process began by developing a clear plan. The plan would have to be straightforward and economical with a set goal in mind. After the engineering processes where set in motion drawings where developed.
I have 15 years experience designing components and systems in 9 fields of engineering. Iâ€™m not the ground level engineer that designs the â€œWidgetâ€ from scratch. Iâ€™m the senior engineer that global technology companies call when they need multi-million dollars systems to work.
I looked for materials that would in theory work either by themselves or in layers. The material requirements where that they must block all spectrums of wireless communications used in all cell phones and wireless devices. They must be pliable and not require factory machine processes to assemble. They must be durable and easy to clean and they must not cost an arm and a leg.
I spent 4 months purchasing and testing various fabrics. After dozens of failures and trials I was successful. I found the combination of fabrics that met all the requirements. Eureka!
Fabric Prototype January 2013
I took my hand made prototypes to several manufactures that didnâ€™t think the project was worth their time. Fortunately, we found one here in Phoenix, AZ. They turned out 60 or so of a production prototype run. With our first run we achieve 100% signal blocking capability. Eureka!
Material used in prototyping
Along the way we met several other small business firms. We developed close working relationships with the material suppliers and the prototype manufacturer. I personally secured 2 alternatives for each and have agreements in place to start production immediately after funding is received. Shipping and receiving will be handled internally at our production facility. We have reviewed 3 alternatives for a small testing and shipping facility and are prepared to move in immediately when funded.
Final Accepted Materials Prototype
I have over 15 years in production and manufacturing. I have lead projects setting up work stations from electronics testing to 5 foot wide ultrasonic flow meters. I have been lean manufacturing trained and practiced so much my middle name should be Six Sigma. Lastly, I am driven to deliver the highest quality for the worldâ€™s first real alternative to being spied on and used like a cheap mule by the corporate giants and governments that wish to know me through my cell phone better that I know myself.
I developed friendly working relationship with each piece of the Rapp It Up project. I treat these people with respect and we trust each other to continue to deliver the best products possible. Everyone involved in this project agrees that this is the right time for this product and they support it 100%.
Rapp It Up is a sole proprietorship with that is singularly focused on providing a low cost and easy to use personal wireless device protective device. We have all the pieces in place to ensure that the Rapp It Up product line is ready to go into full production as soon as weâ€™re funded. Supply chains, manufacturing, and testing have all been put into place. Local small business owners are standing by to help provide a new level of protection for wireless device owners. All of our agreements are in place and we look forward to lasting relationships with them.

What is a Rapp It Up?
The product is a semi-fabric wireless network RF/EMI shielding pocket/sleeve for cell phones, wireless tablets, computers and wireless technology microchip embedded credit cards. The pocket/sleeve provides security in the form of denying manually or automatically communications by the device such as location and location history, web page history and stored data. The device user places their cell phones, wireless tablets, computers and wireless technology microchip embedded credit cards inside the pocket/sleeve and it protects the enclosed device from any RF or wireless access of that device. This security provides the device user with peace of mind knowing that their secure information stored on the device cannot be accessed for any reason especially those that the device owner is aware of.
Where weâ€™re at?
We have been developing Rapp It Up for a little more than 7 months. We are forming a great team of material suppliers, manufacturers, graphic artists and collaborators. The security sleeves you see are production prototype first articles. Weâ€™re about 80% of the way to having the cell phone engineering, design and development complete.
Currently, we need to develop the tablet laptop and hand held game console models. The cell phone Rapp It Up â€œStealth Modelâ€ functions so well (Tested @ 100% wireless signal blocking) we are planning on modeling all of the larger models in a nearly identical design specs.              
The closing mechanism (Spring Frame) used in the cell phone model is tried and true. Spring frames were what was used on change purses for decades. We are developing new designs to use a similar product to use on the computer sized units.
Currently the there is only one color available. We are working with the supplier to offer additional colors like Silver, Charcoal Black and perhaps a Dark Hunter Green or Teal and Cobalt Blue. Each would have that beautiful sheen you see on our golden bronze colored cell phone model.
Radio commercial ads were run on 101.1 THE BEAT in the Phoenix Arizona urban radio market to develop name recognition. Our website launched on February 14, 2013. It is extremely rough and weâ€™re continuing to develop. We are going to be conducting a radio interview at the end of May on KFNX Independent Talk 1100 AM. Stay tuned weâ€™ll provide the details as they become available.
SENTRY PROBE
Hello, my name is Jay Salsburg. I am an Electronics Engineer specializing in RADAR Science; the sole developer of SENTRY PROBE, a personal security device using RADAR, ongoing for 8 years in secrecy until now. SENTRY PROBE has evolved over the years and is finally a portable, handheld device. With your help, together we can bring this new technology to the public.
SENTRY PROBE's Assets
SENTRY PROBE continuously reports hidden movement (people) through doors and walls with a beeping sound, or may be switched to silent mode using only its LED without the beeper. Ask yourself â€œWhy would anyone want such a thing as this?â€ SENTRY PROBE puts penetrating Doppler RADAR small enough to be carried in your pocket, just like a Smart Phone puts a telephone in your pocket. SENTRY PROBE is pocket-sized, portable, hand held, and low-cost. SENTRY PROBE is meant to detect an intruder without their knowledge. To dismiss the issue of microwaves, a cell phone emits 100 times more microwave energy. SENTRY PROBE uses very low power Doppler RADAR motion detection. Its excellent sensitivity to low level RADAR is achieved through clever Electronic Engineering. SENTRY PROBE detects human movement both in direct contact or at armâ€™s length from the surface of interest. Hidden movement is reported unattended without interruption, occurring in the field of view of the RADAR; a pattern of detection much like that of a floodlight. Most residential doors and walls are semi-transparent, like shower door glass, to SENTRY PROBE. All SENTRY PROBE has to do is detect someone approaching the door or wall before they reach it, which SENTRY PROBE does very well.
The term â€œsituation awarenessâ€ is used by Military and First/Emergency Responders to convey the sense they get from reliable information when encountering hazard or danger. With SENTRY PROBE, you and they can continuously maintain immediate situational awareness of anyone invisibly moving behind a door or wall of interest.
I first had this idea in the late 1970s, that of using RADAR to detect people moving behind closed doors, when I bought a Security System for my home. It had a new device in it that used RADAR to detect motion. I noticed the alarm would falsely trigger when someone came to the front door, before the visitor knocked on the door. The RADAR devices available then were too large and cumbersome to make a practical device that would fit in your pants pocket, hand bag, or glove compartment. Today, the huge advancements in new electronics technology has made miniature â€œPersonal RADARâ€ possible. With your help, SENTRY PROBE may be significantly reduced in cost and size, improved in detection sensitivity, increased in efficiency, and include added functions. The prototype detects motion continuously on a single 9 volt battery for several hours which will improve using inexpensive rechargeable lithium Cell Phone batteries. The target operating time is 24 hours on a single charge.
Movement generates distinctive sounds emanating from SENTRY PROBE which is instinctively interpreted as movement easily heard even in noisy situations. It may be hand-held, hung on a doorknob for unattended alerts, placed on the ground/floor, mounted on a tripod with its built-in camera mount, suspended on a pole for scanning through high windows, walls and roofs, extended into places that are hazardous, even mounted on a robot or drone. If you are required to detect movement in sensitive situations or through choke points, SENTRY PROBE can warn you if there is any movement, especially in complete darkness.
SENTRY PROBE detects movement:
Through walls of adjacent rooms and buildings
Through floors, ceilings, and roofs
Through windows with curtains and blinds
In blind hallways
Around corners
From inside to outside
From outside to inside
From inside to outside to inside (Inside one room or building to inside another room or building.)
SENTRY PROBE can alert you of anyone moving in a sensitive area like your driveway, carport, porch, dark area, behind closed doors, or through walls. Hunters in the wilderness and Pest Controllers inside buildings can use SENTRY PROBE to detect animal movement in areas of interest or through walls especially in complete darkness; detects deer, rabbits, rodents, possums, squirrels, and raccoons in a crawl space, attic, behind and under furniture, or outside.

Static Cling Camera Covers for You!
Over 50 individual, reusable Static Cling Camera Covers in each sheet will bring you peace of mind, protect your privacy and brighten up all your devices!  Simply place a static cling camera cover on any camera lens to ensure hackers cannot get video streams of you without your knowledge.  
Hi, I'm Jeff.  Let me tell you the story of how this came to be.  My friend and I started our company, Despicably Good, LLC, to write apps.  Along the way, we realized that we sit in front of internet enabled cameras all day, every day. I'm sure you spend a good deal of time in front of these devices too. So when news broke about hackers breaking into people's web cams, baby monitors and other internet enabled video capable devices, we got concerned. I didn't want video of me to be streamed all over the internet for nefarious purposes. More than that, when I thought of the possibility of my wife, my family and friends being unwittingly recorded, I had to do something!
So Static Cling Camera Covers was born!
The static clings completely block light from even entering the camera lens, so you can be sure no matter what video of you is not being stolen. Plus, the fun designs fit any camera lens and look great!
How did we choose the design, you ask? Well, everyone loves a good happy face emoji, so that was a must.  My wife likes the bumble bee, and I like the butterfly so those choices made it to the sheet.  The "No NSA" sign is a great conversation piece.  And the dots, camera lens replicas, and blank black or white spaces are all for a subtler look that still protects your privacy.  Flower, target, sun and star all add to the fun factor!  Plus, each Static Cling Camera Cover sheet packs in over 50 individual clings!
When will I get my stuff?  
The designs are near final, the print shop has printed several small batch test runs, and some of the first test runs are still clinging to my fridge after six months of hanging out!  And, my wife, my business partner and I have been using the clings on our laptops, iPhones, Android phones, iPads and more for all that time too, meaning the product is fully tested!  
So, as soon as we're funded, I'll finalize the design, print the full batch, purchase the shipping materials and send the survey out to all of you to get your US shipping addresses.  Once I get the Static Cling Camera Covers printed in bulk, I'll start the fulfillment process - mailing out the Static Cling Camera Covers to all of you!  Based on previous, small batch runs, I expect about 2-4 week printing turn around so delivery to all of you in August to early September!
Another little note: I mention it in the video, post it on our web site, and print it on the Static Cling Camera Cover sheets themselves, but I want to say it again here.  Please, keep small plastic items away from babies and unsupervised kids.
Thank you for your support!
-Jeff
Secure Home Inventory
In 2009 Net Eagles was asked to create an online home inventory system by an entrepreneur. Just before we were able to complete the system that company dropped out of the project leaving us with a almost completed product. We elected to complete the project and post the site which has remained to this day but we have never done any marketing of the site to get it up to its potential.
With recent emphasis from insurance companies recommending to all of us that we can get quicker and higher claims processing if we would simply have a detailed listing with pictures of our belongings. Each of us has watch the recent Farmers Insurance commercial on TV telling us "What if you didn't know" statements with one being that you can improve your claims by having pictures of your stuff. If you follow their advice and take pictures, you obviously can have those pictures located in your home. What if your home is destroyed in a disaster and the pictures and descriptions of your items would be gone as well. The solution is www.HomeSecureInventory.com. Using a secure online service helps you to easily but effectively and efficiently manage your listing of your possessions.
Our servers are located in a secure facility in the Dallas Data Center in Infomart, Dallas, TX. This is a facility that was built especially for housing servers and currently is being used by many Fortune 500 companies for their servers. We have full technical support 24 X 7 X 365 and daily back up of content and data retaining minimum of 7 points. Our servers are fully secured and are dedicated to our company and only accessible by Net Eagles.
With increased awareness of the need to keep an inventory, we feel that now is the perfect opportunity to improve the product that was built and combine with some unique marketing approaches. First we need to update the web site. Research shows that as of this year, utilization of the internet by mobile devices will exceed the use of traditional desktop computers. If a web application is not set up for mobile usage it is doomed before you start since over 50% of web users will not be able to use it appropriately. This update will be the for the site information, the shopping cart and the data collection process. The entire process for the site will be converted to mobile compatible.
Next we want to market the product beyond just selling to home owners that just purchase one, this site was set up to market to businesses that can purchase licenses in bulk and then give away to home owners or renters or even college students as a way for them to track their possessions but also puts the name and information about the business in front of the customer each and every time they access their account. We set up a special header that includes information graphic about the business that sponsored that user and they can even click on the information to go to their web site.
Below is an example of how we displayed the business information on the original site.
Sponsored Business Example
 The Budget
The update of the web site which includes making the site mobile ready, improving the business marketing interface structure, updates to the inventory system and reporting functions will require $5,000.00.  The remainder of the project will be used for marketing of the site to get our name in  front of businesses that can benefit from our services.
We plan to have the updates completed by November 2014 and able to complete the benefits packages that include licenses to the system in November and we will start on any web sites that are with the larger packages in November and finish up by end of January 2015.

Scams flood the Internet every minute, and fraud continues to proliferate as more people are online on a daily basis. Have you ever wished that you could be connected to VALID information about your celebrity, athlete, TV program, film, event, representative, or favorite brand?
YayWay is a revolutionary, web-based app that is free, authentic, free from clutter and is a breeze to use. It is a true breakthrough in technology, a one-stop shop where all content is validated. If you are connected to Christina Aguilera through our app, you can be confident that we have VERIFIED that it is Christina Aguilera. And just as importantly, you wonâ€™t risk a scam site stealing your identity!
YayWay bridges the gap between valid content providers and consumers. No more wandering through mazes of scattered and conflicting postings. Our information is authentic each and every time you connect!
My name is Charles Simmons, Founder and CEO of YayWay. During the day I run my business; at night Iâ€™m a songwriter, recording artist and producer. I received a platinum CD award for the song, Mariya, featured on The Games' CD, â€œThe Documentary.â€ My music has been sampled by Wiz Khalifa, Fabolous and others.
I decided to create YayWay when I found that I couldnâ€™t even find valid information about myself!
Not only were there many people with the same name, but there were some who pretended to be me, and a few were even auctioning and selling my music without my permission! There had to be a way to get a direct line to true material. And so â€“ the idea of YayWay was conceived!
YayWay has partnered with Sports 1 Marketing Warren Moon Enterprises to provide you with a healthy dose of C.A.R.B.A. (Celebrities, Athletes, Representatives, Brands and Artists). We are hoping to form a community that values the â€œexperience of a moment.â€ It only takes a moment to miss an event, a concert, a sale â€“ all because of conflicting information.
Although our first campaign failed to reach its goal, we gained momentum in several ways. 1. We gained a much larger social media following, 2. we gained a lot of media attention, 3. we have been moving forward with the development of the web-app on our own, and that is the reason our new goal on kickstarter is only $15,000. 
We are currently racing to raise funds to complete development, for our impending worldwide launch and need your support to help us to the finish line! Kickstarter campaigns operate under an â€œall-or-nothingâ€ funding model. That means if the YayWay project doesn't reach its goal of $15,000 at the end of 35 days we won't receive anything.
Every dollar will help us finish developing our app and preparing to launch! In return for your pledge, you will get some great thank you gifts and will be invited to celebrate with us at our YayWay Launch Party. Pledge today! Our future is in your hands!
If you think we're stopping there, you have another thing coming. We're working night and day to fill the gaps that the other guys left open.

 Testimonial by Michael Redmond
I just wanted to let you guys know that this sounds like a great idea. I truly think that this app could solve a ton of issues. I've had numerous discussions with close friends who are in bands/have their own label and I've communicated how facebook alone has become a very messy experience. I end up missing information about events/developments about things I actually want to know about because it gets buried in an ocean of otherwise useless posts. I will definitely be spreading the word about this project!
I have been using the Square App for processing credit cards for the past several weeks at a corn maze I've been running.  I have been using the nClosures iPad Kiosk Mount to be able to immediately process credit cards via 3G. I haven't been using the full iPad features of the Square App so I thought I would get a smaller enclosure setup which I could attach to a table. 
It allows us to quickly process credit cards even out in the middle of a farm. It also keeps our gadgets safe from being nabbed while thousands of people pass through the ticket booth. The enclosure has a security lock screw and a Kensington laptop hole for using a cable lock.
We would like to get started with fabricating these and hope to find out how many others out there have a similar need.  In exchange for helping us get going, we will give you a special Kickstarter-only pricing and you'll be one of the first to receive one of these aluminum enclosures for the iPhone or iPod Touch. They will retail for $99.
Today, lots of us own a smart phone. And we all need it everywhere we go. Smartphones have improved our lives in so many ways, but have become a bit time consuming. Agree? While dealing with it, it may destruct your life especially when you are on wheels. Sometimes a matter of life and death. 
 That is where our BOOLZE solution comes into play.

  There is a very large demand for a more efficient and safer way to restrict cargo from moving or becoming loose from a fatigued worker whom hasn't checked his or her cargo. This will help the shipping industry globally.
There are 4.8 million miles of road in the U.S, each and every day we travel these roads unaware of the possible danger this on the road around us from flatbed trucks. On the picturesque roadways of the U.S, flatbed truck accidents all too often create an unsafe, ugly scene. Of the roughly half million truck accidents that occur each year flat bed trucks make up a great portionâ€”both through collisions and unsecured cargo.
A flatbed truck is a large vehicle used for commercial purposes with a minimum gross weight of 10,000 pounds, discounting the weight of any passengers or cargo.
                                          TYPES OF FLATBED TRUCK ACCIDENTS
Many flatbed truck accidents are caused because of the load they are carrying, logs, among other types of lumber, are generally transported using flatbed trucks. Sometimes when a flatbed accident occurs the load on the truck are shifted forward due to the impact, and come crashing into the cab of the truck after crushing the cab guards.
Flatbeds are used to haul many types of loads, including motors, cranes, building materials, concrete beams, dry wall ect. These loads have to be â€œtied downâ€ to the flatbed and secured thoroughly. The drivers of the flatbed truck are also required to periodically stop their trucks, check their loads and ensure that their cargo is secured properly and that there is no cause for concern. Even though flatbed truck drivers are careful for the most part, sometimes errors in securing the load adequately, or failure to regularly check the loads while on the road can lead to a serious flatbed truck accident. The MOTORIZED TIE DOWN is designed to drastically cut the handling of the â€œold ratchet tie downâ€ method in half and safely secure the loads to the flatbed they will simply press a button. Drivers no longer have to be exposed to hot or cold elements or after hours of driving have to roll a messy strap, this design is made to safely and cleanly retract in its casing and stores easily.
EyeWitnessâ„¢ Personal Surveillance Application
 Put your $1 towards a safer tomorrow.
EyeWitnessâ„¢
This project was greatly inspired by the recent blaze of police brutality across America. 
R.I.P. to the 1116 people who have died this year at the hands of police as of 12/9/2015.
In 2014 alone, Police across the USA killed 1,149 people. This is more than the death toll for the Iraqi and Afghan war that same year, combined. We are seeking to bring these actions, that have reared itâ€™s head on our society for entirely too long, to an end. The fight against police brutality has not been an easy one. However, the inception and uprising of technology such as smart phones have slightly heightened the number of police brutality convictions And in some cases (recording devices) deter Law Enforcement from using excessive force. While this is a milestone that was attained by going against the grain, we should think about what it is exactly that hinders these convictions. The main source of polarity stems from law enforcement officers that have set out to harass, attack, and illegally arrest citizens that video-record injustices throughout America, resulting in inaccurate accounts of events. Amongst the corruption that we are forcibly subdued to, an auxiliary resource has arisen that can assist further in our efforts.

 The Eyewitnessâ„¢ Personal Surveillance System is a proposed step towards holding law enforcement accountable for unjustified actions. This is an application for smart phones that uses real-time video production to bring the crime scene to the courtroom. It works by turning the userâ€™s mobile device into a secure password protected recording vault. Each video is automatically uploaded to the userâ€™s cloud account to ensure your data is tamper-proof and readily available, also ensuring safekeeping in the event that the device is destroyed. In order to put this application into production, we are asking for your patronage. Assistance is needed for developmental costs. We would like to have the application made without outsourcing, which sacrifices quality that cannot be risked. 
Safety In Your Hands
 This is a powerful tool that will let the jury and everyone see EXACTLY what happened, avoiding being falsely accused or inaccurately reported about. Without video evidence, the police officerâ€™s testimony/statement will be considered truth, and is virtually impossible to dispute against in court. Stand with us against police brutality and corruption by aiding in a cause that can truly hold EVERYONE accountable for their actions. 
The Good News? 
The recent emergence of smartphone technology has led to a slight increase in the number of police brutality convictions across the country. Smartphone owners now outnumber users of more basic phones. At any moment there are more than 100 million Americans in reach of a device that can capture police misconduct and share it with the world in seconds. 
EyeWitnessâ„¢
Yes, that's Good News, But...
Yes, that's good news, but many Law Enforcement  Officers have set out to harass, attack, and even illegally arrest video-recording bystanders, in an attempt to confiscate and/or destroy video evidence of police brutality. In these situations, all we can hope for is a safe, secure, and most of all, ACCURATE account of the events that transpire at the scene. There are currently no apps on the market with the speed, safety, and security as Eyewitnessâ„¢.
EyeWitnessâ„¢
Without video evidence, the Police Officer's Testimony/Statement is considered the truth, and is nearly impossible to dispute in court.
 EyeWitnessâ„¢ is the answer. Bring the crime scene to the courtroom. Let the jury see EXACTLY what happened. Never be falsely accused of anything again.

What is it?
AmeriText is a web application that integrates several mediums for communication, including secure instant-messaging and SMS texting, into one interface with a unique queuing system designed to allow one user to hold many conversations at once.
You may have used something similar already (Google Voice and Meebo spring to mind) but this is *different* because it's designed to scale to hundreds of conversations and it goes out of its way to solve common business communication problems.
What are some of the best features?
Instant Messaging and presence: Chat with other users in your organization and know when they are on the system.
SMS: Send and receive text messages as seamlessly as with instant messaging.
Broadcast: Send a message to any number of contacts, a couple or thousands, at once. When replies come back, you can respond to each person individually.
Priority: Conversations are given a color-coded priority rating based upon how long contacts have been waiting for a response.
Sorting & Organization: AmeriText stacks overflow conversations in an "elevator" queuing system that sorts conversations by priority. When you're done chatting with someone, just click the "swap" button to swap that finished conversation with the next one in the elevator.
Address Book: Allows you to group and organize your contacts and their info, as well as sort contacts into groups for one-click broadcast messaging.
Call and Text Forwarding: Phone calls and texts to your AmeriText SMS number are sent seamlessly to your cell phone or any phone you choose.
History: Search your entire conversation history by name, date, or keyword.
Search: Find a contact or group quickly just by typing their name or the name of the group.
Prepared Responses: Do you find yourself constantly sending the same messages ("Is it plugged in?", "Is it turned on?", "Try restarting.")? Add them as prepared responses and drop them into conversations with a click or a keyboard shortcut.
Who are you?
We're AmeriText, a group of five techies who have created a cool new way to manage your real-time business communications.
Why did you make it?
Like you, we spent a lot of time texting, emailing, and calling people to keep our businesses running. We saw an opportunity to make this easier, so we built our dream interface and have been using it ourselves with great success. As others got wind of what we had built, we got some great feedback about how our ideas could help other businesses. It was obvious we had to make this system available to everyone and AmeriText was born.
The Bottom Line
AmeriText allows a single individual to do the communication work of many. This means the entrepreneur can be on a sales call while offering support via text at the same time by using the AmeriText system, and a lone customer service rep can carry the workload of five or more. One person is able to do the work of many: Thatâ€™s the AmeriText bottom line.
What do you get?
We can offer early access to the system before it's available to the general public and we can offer special discounted rates for early adopters. We also have more great features planned for upcoming releases. Your funding will help support the creation of these new features and will provide for the infrastructure needed to expand the AmeriText system.
Project goal
Our goal is to sign up hundreds of highly-motivated early adopters who will help us take our software from late beta to production over the next few months. We already have a late beta ready for use by our backers. Next, we will work with backers to polish the product and implement the few features that will take our software from a great idea to a finished product.
Progress
We will be putting people on the system as soon as the Kickstarter campaign is complete.
What's the Money For?
Building AmeriText required a lot of development work. We've already spent a substantial amount of time getting to this late beta phase and we need your assistance to see it to completion. We'll be using your funding to put in additional equipment for higher capacity, ensure a high level of server redundancy and start the marketing process.
Who we are
We're a small staff led by Jesse Lowther, Dan Connor and three other guys.
We really appreciate your support! We'll talk soon.
Passwords suck. But they are a fact of modern life. Whatâ€™s even worse is that security experts say we should create unique passwords for every site so if one login is compromised all of your information is not available to hackers. Then we are supposed to change your passwords on a regular basis. Not a lot of us do though. That is why password managers are great for those who want to manage their online life. But even the best managers still require that you remember a master password which can been forgotten or forced from you. We think there is a better way.
We are building a convenient password manager that doesn't need a password, just a flick across your smartphone's screen to make all of your security information available. Now you can keep all of your passwords on your phone securely even if it is lost or stolen. You can have different user names/passwords for each of your sites and limit the fall out of all too frequent security breaches like the heart bleed bug or the latest hacker attack.
KineticID
Zighra's KineticID provides effortless, automatic, and instantaneous user recognition by adding an invisible security layer to PassZwype authentication. KineticID implicitly recognizes a user based on their habits and interaction patterns. It measures the userâ€™s unique kinetic interaction signature, such as the way the user holds their phone, the angle in which they hold it, the touch screen pressure, and acceleration of the swipe etc. By avoiding mandatory explicit mechanisms such as PINS, passwords, and other biometrics â€“ KineticID brings the ultimate in user convenience without compromising security. You don't need to remember a master password or expensive additional hardware.
The patented KineticID algorithm required your phone be equipped with common features. These are found in most modern smartphones:
A Multi-touch screen
A Gyroscope
An Accelerometer
PassZwype
With PassZwype, your phone will analyze each finger swipe. If your motions match what the phone has learned from your previous swipes, then it lets you in. It takes a few days for our application to really get to know you, but once trained you will be able to just swipe your finger across the screen to access your passwords. If you are having problems with the swipe, there is always a fallback password.
One problem with using Android phones is that there are just so many of them. We have not been able to completely test the technology on all of the devices. PassZwype is known to work on the following:
Galaxy S4
Galaxy S5
Nexus 4
Nexus 5
LG phones
We do know it does not work on the following:
Motorola Moto G
HTC Desire
We are continually validating more devices.
PassZwype secures all of the information with 256 bit AES encryption using the KeePass backend. Since we are using the open KeePass file format, you can access your passwords on other KeePass applications on your PC, Mac or Linux computers. Just share the encrypted KeePass file with your other devices and you have your passwords on wherever you need it.
ZwypeLock
ZwypeLock is Zighra's first implementation of a KineticID to lock the screen of Android phones. It allows a user unlock their phone with just a swipe of their finger instead of inputting a password. This app keeps your phone easily accessible while at the same time keeps your phone secure. It is currently requires Android 4.3 or above and is being tested in a closed beta. ZwypeLock is known to work on:
Samsung S3
Samsung S4
Samsung S5
Nexus 4
Nexus 5
PLAY

Why we need your help
Most password manager applications require a subscription. While that is great for the software company, it is not the great for your wallet. Subscriptions also keep many from using a password manager and that harms everyone's security. We have a better model. A one time purchase of PassZwype will get the manager into anyone's hand. KineticID has been coded and is being beta tested on Zighra's ZwypeLock screen lock app. But we'd like to get this technology out faster for everyone's security. Help us to complete PassZwype application and get it into the app stores.
We developed the secureBUBBLES WiFi capability to allow users to:
Collaborate with other co-workers in foreign / domestic locations where they may not want the risk of potential prying eyes via the public Internet enabled WiFi' hot spots.
Use it to demonstrate software applications to prospects. By having them choose the secureBUBBLES portable WiFi Hotspot, prospects can then log into any peer-to-peer application running from a laptop or device connected to the secureBUBBLES network.
Open the security on the secureBUBBLES connection and it defaults to a self contained web site that is managed via browser. Once your secureBUBBLES is selected, no matter what a connected user types into theirbrowser; it will default to its on-board website. Great for advertising in public venues or use it to provide a portable instruction site for training when at a remote location.
Imagine what you could do with a portable WiFi network that is secure and NOT required to be connected to the Internet. For more information visit the secureBUBBLES.com web page.
Giving Back - After developing the secureBUBBLES hardware device, based on the Raspberry Pi, we immediately saw its potential to connect African students to their teachers in remote areas where the Internet is not available.  By placing one secureBUBBLES running on a low 5 volts in a classroom, children using donated, inexpensive laptops can connect to a private network where they learn about technology processes and interact more effectively with others. secureBUBBLES further enable teachers to manage coursework on a web server that they control.
Get your bumper sticker ($20) or T-shirt ($49) to show your support!
As a part of this campaign, for every secureBUBBLES purchased on KICKSTARTER we will provide one to a needy community in Africa.
Myth: firmware viruses are rare
Its a myth that firmware viruses are a rare hypothetical only the paranoid need fret. *Nearly all modern sophisticated virus attacks include firmware virus modules. *Dozens of companies provide firmware virus exploit services to governments, corporations, or other clients. Amateurs can create firmware modules based on open source tools. *100,000's of computers have been infected by firmware viruses. *Example: The infamous Stuxnet that the US sent to Iran infected >10,000 computers. *Example: Flame infected >1,000's of computers. Most Stuxnet and Flame infections included firmware virus modules.
When an attacker sends a virus, they are giving away their weapon. For example, the government of Iran gained access to sophisticated attack code. Iranians announced plans to turn the exploit against other countries. Today, 100's if not 1000's of organizations have access to dozens of types of firmware viruses.
What can a firmware virus do?
*They can exploit a kernel buffer overflow vulnerability. Since it occurs at the kernel level, this allows near total control of a computer. Vulnerable OS's are known. -All versions of Microsoft's Windows, even the latest Windows 8.1, and Windows Mobile. -Apple's Mac OS and iOS. -Most Linux installations. -*BSD's *Username and password replay or other replay attacks. Getting your employees to unplug their keyboards every time they step away from the keyboard is impractical. *Keylogging or logging other data from a virus on the computer for later recovery. -A physical intruder may steal or swap the keyboard or download the keylog. -Replaying keystrokes to an emanations monitoring system hidden nearby. *Simply make the keyboard stop working altogether or seem to have a broken key at a random time in the future.
You trust your private data to many companies. These companies sometimes suffer virus infections. By protecting them you are protecting yourself.
Repair is difficult
*A virus can fool the user into thinking a firmware update succeeded when it did not. *There is a lack of trustworthy software tools for performing the upload. Popular anti-virus products are unable to detect or repair firmware virus infections. *Manufacturers often do not provide valid firmware downloads for keyboards. *IT service companies charge prohibitive prices for firmware virus cleanup. There is no guarantee that your keylog data is safe with them. For most users, the only reliable solution is to replace a keyboard.
Disposal is difficult. Your private data may be stored in your keyboard's firmware flash. If you throw away or sell your keyboard, someone may get your data.
Consider a small business with 100 computers and 2 suspected infections in 1 year. This could cost $9,000 to replace $45 keyboards. It could cost >$3,000 to hire an IT service company to verify all of their firmware.
What is emanations monitoring
Faint electromagnetic signals are unintentionally given off by your computer as it sends or receives data over bus cables to or from peripherals. Any attacker with the right equipment can eavesdrop, successfully interpret this data in realtime and record it. Longer cables, such as USB or PS/2 cables for keyboards or VGA, DVI, or HDMI cables for video and ethernet networking cables are most vulnerable. For example, if you live in an apartment your neighbor could be watching a screen showing exactly what is on your screen at any time, and what you are typing. A hobbyist can easily create a receiver that lets them tell whenever you press a key, and give it to your neighbor, which can show how long your password is.
How common is emanations monitoring?
Admittedly, emanations monitoring seems to be less common than firmware virus attacks. However, the necessary equipment costs less than $1500. Range is typically up to 18 meters or more. Most medium sized to large technology companies or universities have sufficient engineering talent to design a simple version from scratch in house. It is not de facto illegal. The equipment is passive, much like watching someone with an infrared camera through a wall, meaning most victims would have no way of knowing if they were being spied on. This means the strategy could be or soon become more common than we realize.
How common are vulnerable keyboards?
Most if not all in-production USB keyboards available at major Internet and physical retailers voluntarily accept unauthenticated firmware updates at any time over a standard USB firmware upload protocol.
We cannot prove there is a conspiracy to make your computer vulnerable to viruses. However we can prove that companies are designing peripherals that way. Why might this be?
Retailers sell the following:
-AV software.
-Replacements of both hardware and software when systems become infected.
Hardware manufacturers:
-Hardware makers sell replacements for infected systems. -Hardware makers own stock in AV software companies.
Software companies:
-In addition to selling AV software,
-users often replace other expensive software when they replace infected hardware.
IT service companies sell virus removal services and a host of other defense services.
Governments:
-Viruses are used to spy on and influence citizens.
-Collect taxes from the production, transport, and sale of replacement systems.
Shipping companies profit from sending replacements.
How defense can work
Good news is defense is easy. A good keyboard should defend against these attacks.
Firmware viruses.
-Just do not accept firmware updates.
-Alternatively, require a secure code or a physically present user to provide informed consent by reading a warning label and pressing a button. Automatically checksum the firmware to verify its integrity.
Swapping by a physical intruder. A keyboard can uniquely identify itself to a computer and to a user. This may slow down an intruder since it would require discovering and copying all of the physical and electronic identifiers.
Emanations monitoring. Hardware only shielding solutions are expensive. A more affordable reliable solution is the following.
-Encryption of the traffic between the computer and keyboard.  This may begin with a public key encryption based key exchange protocol.
-Obfuscation including
+dummy keystrokes
+temporal obfuscation using the dummy keystrokes
Production environment security, secure supply chain, and tamper evident packaging are important as well.
Key features of our products
Warning the user if the computer attempts to upload a firmware virus by flashing LEDs or activating a buzzer (which can be disabled if desired). 
An optional connector set may be included that allows the keyboard to power off the computer if a firmware virus upload attempt occurs.
Blocking firmware viruses.
Uniquely identifying the keyboard to the user and to the computer to prevent a physical intruder from easily swapping it.  Your keyboard may have a recognizable name that shows up in the kernel log.  It may have a name or small discrete picture visible to the user or flash LEDs in a distinctive pattern at start up.
Encryption to thwart emanations monitoring.
Secure supply chain options.
Business plan
Already achieved development milestones.
Acquired a ~$30,000 Samsung CP-20 PCB assembly robot with a full set of supporting accessories, a medium sized reflow oven, large stencil gantry, a hot air rework station, and development tools for a microcontroller.
Developed and manufactured a replacement for the PCB in an Off The Shelf (OTS) keyboard.
Started developing the firmware.  As of mid-December, it can blink LEDs and can scan keys but still depends on the programmer to interface with a computer.
Upcoming development milestones
1. January 20.  Finish the firmware.  This gives a firmware virus resistant keyboard.
2. January 15 â€“ March 24.  Finish firmware and Windows drivers for the encrypted protocol, and an installer for the Windows drivers. This gives an emanations monitoring resistant keyboard.
3. March 3.  We may also be required to obtain an FCC ID and UL certification for each initial product and do associated independent lab testing.  We should have delivered articles to an independent lab by this date.  I am unsure of the local labs' lead times which is why their completion date is not exact.  Labs of these types often take 2 - 8 weeks.
4. February 3 â€“ March 24.  Finish layout and prototype production of PCBs for an additional 2 â€“ 3 brands or models of OTS keyboards.
5. April 30.  Finish drivers for at least one additional OS. See order below.
6. If >$200,000 is received.  Ideally, we would eliminate the labor cost of opening the packaging and disassembling the OTS keyboard and the manufacturing cost of its PCB.  If we raise sufficient funds we can do this for the more popular styles by buying unassembled keyboards or injection molding our own keyboards.  Tooling for injection molding is expensive, and other methods of production may fail to save the customer money.
*CAD work for the first model should be done by May 30.
*A mold should be prepared by July 31.
Keyboard types
My top priority for the next keyboard is a professional looking mid-range quiet keyboard.  This should be a safe choice that businesses and government customers would feel comfortable supplying to their employees.  I have chosen the Microsoft Logitech keyboard shown in the pictures.
Mini.  The first development keyboard shown in the pictures is a mini.
An additional mid-range quiet keyboard, such as one that is not contoured.
The following are unconfirmed.  These depend on the votes by contributors.
Flexible water resistant standard size and mini.
Rigid water resistant.
Foreign layouts.
High end, such as a mechanical switch gaming keyboard.
Drivers Planned in order:  1. Windows XP+, 2. Linux 3+.  The order for the following is unconfirmed: 3. Mac OS X+, 4. Android 4+, 5. iOS, 6. FreeBSD 9+.  Drivers are expected to be open source for at least essential functionality on the host side on OSS OS's.
Production location
Our PCBs were fabbed in the Northwest and likely will continue to be.  PCB assembly, and upgrading and repackaging OTS keyboards will be done at our own facility for the following reasons:  we already have a chip shooter and reflow oven, and some customers such as military or other government customers may want a secure supply chain.  This facility will most likely be located in Oregon or southwest Washington state.  If we succeed in negotiating to buy wholesale unassembled keyboards, most of these are currently made in China.  Large molds are typically made in China or sometimes Vietnam while small molds are often made in the country where they will be used.  Since shipping molds is slow, and to help test them, a small initial production run is often done there before shipping the molds overseas.  Making the plastic parts in a controlled facility is not as important for security.  However, producing locally reduces shipping cost and may be necessary for products that require final assembly in controlled facilities.  For this reason if a mold is purchased, it would likely be used in the US.  There is a chance that in 2015 it may be shifted to a secure facility in a country with lower labor prices, such as Central America.  Electronics for certain customers would continue to be made in the US.
Blank prototype PCBs in their packaging as evidence they were designed in house. They appear stuffed in the video.
Blank new PCBs with silkscreen in packaging showing compatible card edge connector next to the original and key matrix.
Please vote for other keyboards for us to enhance. I have this Microsoft Logitech keyboard in mind as a safe professional looking choice for commercial customers.
I chose blue LEDs for the first prototype.

The world needs Payooze!
Payooze is a Pier-to-Pier secure payment system which allows you to receive or make a secure payment at millions of retail locations globally. Our provisional patent technology allows us to provide the most secure payment system in history. 
We have negotiated with Discover Card to provide the payment transfers and receive secure cash immediately available. 
RECEIVE OR MAKE SECURE PAYMENTS AT MILLIONS OF LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE.   
Our payment system makes it possible to do pier-to-pier and millions of point of sale terminals worldwide. Here is a just a small sample of retailers who will accept Payooze.
We've designed the process to work with any credit or debit cards, bank account or wiring company.  We are working with processors to integrate our system.
OUR PROPRIETY 5 STEP SECURITY 
Payooze has a 5-step security system that protects all data. Upon downloading the application you create a user name and password.
You then activate your account with your own 4-pin code.
A picture is required for each payment card or option within your wallet. Your picture provides a 64 million-bit security to identify your payment information. Your picture cannot be duplicated or taken from your device once you have attached it to Payooze.  It provides our technology with integrated propriety information used to secure each payment option.
Your account is attached to the IP address on your own phone, which secures no one can access your information or make any payments using any other phone or device.
Your geographic location is the final step of security. When you are in a restaurant, store or any other location you are attached to the geo-location. Which means in order for a payment to be made, Payooze verifies your payment by making sure your phone is in the same location you are making a payment. No one can steal your information and try to make a payment from anywhere else or any other device.
Protecting your information is becoming more and more difficult. Although modern technology increases ease and efficiency in our lives, it also makes it easier for criminals to steal personal information.
RFID (radio frequency identification) chips are growing in popularity as the technology spreads across multiple industries. For consumers, this technology is embedded in credit cards, identification cards, passports and more.
Companies embed a small chip in products that allows information to be transmitted to a reader wirelessly, decreasing transaction time. In comparison to traditional credit cards or ID cards which require a strip to be read, products with this technology only require proximity to transmit information and complete transactions. These cards are presented as convenient, but they are also susceptible to being skimmed without ever leaving your pocket.  Please review this youtube video: https://youtu.be/_qfwq22-3f0
The RFID is now being used on watches, rings, straps and other devices.  All of these products use the RFID technology and therefore is subject to the ability of being copied by simple $100 devices one can buy over the internet.
There are companies who are selling card protection covers for $20, while there are apparel companies that sell protection guard clothing for $150 to scramble or detour would be thieves. Payooze makes it possible for you not to worry about your credit cards. You can leave them at home if you want to. NO RFID AND NO ABILITY FOR ANYONE TO STEAL YOUR ACCOUNT
Payooze eliminates the problem by creating a propriety security payment method which provides each user with a specific user Payooze ID number. Every time you are going to make or receive a payment, just write down your ID number to the bill and the establishment will send the transaction to your phone for payment. There is no credit card information to exchange.  Our propriety payment system completes the transaction and money is sent or received immediately as cash.
TIMELINE 
August 2015 â€“ Payooze is founded

At Encrypt1, we are developing the next generation of cyber security technology that will provide a wall of protection around all of our personal and business digital data. This software will be used on smartphones, web browsers, and smart devices as part of the growing adoption of the Internet of Things technologies. This capability will be a genuine breakthrough in the Security space and should greatly improve the way our digital data is protected. Our software will be available for consumers and businesses, universities, non-profit, researches,etc. We will create a platform approach to deliver this capability by building purpose built applications for smartphones-- like digital payment/banking, Secure Data transport--moving files in and out of Cloud services, and secure Voice over IP, just to highlight a few. Our new software will be noninvasive and will be unnoticed by the user-- as such, we will extend existing cyber security capabilities, not replace them. Our team has the extensive mathematics background to ensure a successful migration from 'the chalk board to the design board to the keyboard'. This software will change the way data encryption and transport are managed for mobile phones, web browsers, virtual private networks, and for the Internet of Things devices and services. We should all demand more protection of our personal and business data as it moves from one place to the next. Our new software will solve the biggest cyber security threat today-- data theft and communication hijacking.
My goal for this project is to produce a small box that people can use to hold their valuables (ie rings, hearing aids, small jewelry, etc). The box is made of a lightweight, strong, and durable composite. The composite material consists of cotton fiber cloth which is impregnated with an epoxy resin. The composite material is then machined on a CNC milling machine to the design specifications. Durable brass hinges are used to allow the top to swing open and are secured in place using stainless steel torx screws. An o-ring is placed around the internal cavity to seal it from the elements outside. Lastly, neodymium magnets are used to hold the lid securely closed when your valuables are placed inside.
I need your support so that I can place an order for a large quantity run with the machine house. I have already created several prototypes as seen in the video. This has allowed me to work out most of the kinks in the design so that parts go together smoothly.
All parts are manufactured or purchased in the USA.

The box outside dimensions are 2.00in x 2.12in x 0.68in (width x depth x height).
The box inside cavity dimensions are 1.57in x 1.25in x 0.45in (width x depth x height).
PLAY

You Can Experience The State-of-Science Drone For a Weekend or Week With Just a Small Donation.
  Your donation secures a weekend or week long experience with the new cutting edge DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus or the Walkera TALI H500 aerial videography drone.
Whether you refer to them as Drones, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or as Remotely Piloted Aircrafts (RPA), the aircrafts without a human pilot aboard are permeating popular culture. Flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. 
In many ways, drones enable us to â€œgo where no one has gone beforeâ€ and see things from a unique aerial perspective.
There are several types of drones that have been designed and built for particular functions, military, commercial and recreational.
Up till now, they have been mostly deployed for military applications, and also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as policing and firefighting, and nonmilitary security work, such as surveillance of pipelines. Drones are often preferred for missions that are too hazardous or mundane for manned aircraft.
The FAA banned commercial drone usage within the United States, meaning, that they can't be used by businesses, and can only be used for recreational purposes, while remaining under 55 pounds. This is a bad blow to such companies as Amazon who wanted to provide deliver service with drones.
However, the ability to use a drone for recreational purposes is great news for all of us who dream of flight and seeing the world from a different perspective.
Over the past few years, a hand full of companies has brought to market playful versions of these drones. They have been all created to offer users a thrilling perspective from the skies without causing any harm or breaking any laws. 
PROBLEM â€“ the really good drones with long-range distance and altitude capabilities as well as video and photographic equipment are very expensive to purchase.
SOLUTION â€“ We are the solution. We are ACME WEST, LLC, we are the only company to offer you superior, state-of-the-science drones for just a weekend or week. You donâ€™t need to buy an expensive drone, just get one from us when you want it, for just the time you need it! For a very reasonable donation we are making the most expensive, most dynamic, and technically advanced drones accessible to you as a promotional thank you. Help us; help you see the world from above.
We need your help to build our fleet so more people will have affordable access to these high tech aerial videography drones. Help us build our unique fleet by pledging a donation to secure your time with one of our drones. Watch the three videos we provided for you above. Learn more about the Phantom and the TALI H500. Then pledge your donation.
The first drones we will make available have the latest technological offerings and advances, consequently the best performance. Our initial fleet will be populated with the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus and the Walkera TALI H500 aerial videography drones.
These drones will work autonomously and will be able to follow you when you are in the action - snowboarding, skiing, or even snowboarding. You will be shocked at the ease of use. If you can operate a smart phone, you'll be able to operate one of these drones.
For example, the newest Phantom drone we offer has four fans and is remote-controlled by an operator on the ground. The operator uses a conventional-style remote control to fly the drone and a smartphone to control and monitor the video camera. Pilots can monitor what the camera sees from up to 700 meters away, or about 2,300 feet. Flight speed is an impressive 50 feet per second, or 15 meters per second. The video camera capabilities are unreal: a 90-degree tilt that letâ€™s you shoot subjects directly below the drone.
You will be able to experience the new stabilization technology of the Phantom, a gimbal that reduces jitter and prevents pitching, rolling and yawing, while recording. Your resulting video will be smooth and fluid without unintended jarring movements. The new Phantom drone also has an improved battery, which can keep it in the air for 25 minutes, an upgrade from the 10 minutes with the previous version. Thereâ€™s also an indicator on the battery pack that shows pilots how much battery life is remaining. The drone uses a GPS system that letâ€™s you keep the Phantom in the same spot, hovering, in winds up to 25 per hour and pilots can also program an autonomous flight path. The DJI Vision app letâ€™s you preview footage and access altitude, distance, and battery strength during video/camera shoots. Our Phantom 2 Vision Plus package includes a controller, drone, camera and three-axis gimbal.
Building our inaugural fleet is a huge undertaking. Thatâ€™s why your help is so needed and appreciated.
We are currently working with manufactures at the moment to order the appropriate number of drones from each. We are also working with the most reliable insurance companies as well as domestic and international shipping companies, such as FedEx, DHL, and UPS to provide the protection and service to our donors and future customers.
Securing our fleet and making it available to you, our donors, is priority number one!
We are also putting together a special offer for those of you who will not be able to bring yourselves to returning the drone because of how much fun you're having with it. This special offer will enable you to purchase the drone in lieu of returning it. You will save $$$ over a retail purchase.

How the 'DC' System of Transparent Lawmaking works
Any U.S. citizen may propose new ideas for laws and rate othersâ€™ work.  Verified citizens may vote on the few good bills that survive our thorough public review process.   The RED text shows the path a bill can take in Direct Congress to become a real law:
The Entrepreneur Principal of a job-creating sustainable Roofing Company is leading the creation of this system for transparent informed lawmaking.  Our team in Philadelphia, America's first capital and birthplace of Independence, is fine tuning a strategic plan to build a movement for change.  Please help our Web Development team to finish building this transparent lawmaking forum.
Thank you for building a U.S. Congress that Works for America with your investment today!
Our volunteers in partnership with veteran programmers at women-owned B-Corp YIKES can build "My 'DC' Office", Direct Congress Beta lawmaking forum for $91,000.00.  We will need to raise more funds later to perfect this informed lawmaking system for America.
The world's first cellphone charger or power adapter that securely locks itself into any vehicle's 12-volt power port.
 What that means
PlugTightâ€™s design overcomes many of the common issues inherent in the current design of accessory power adapters. Most notably is that common adapters tend to easily come loose in their sockets causing them to lose connection. Vehicle power ports were originally designed to be an electric cigarette lighter only. These ports were never designed to provide power for any other purpose. Adapters came along to make use of these ports for a variety of mobile applications with varying degrees of success. PlugTight uses a specially formulated polymer band that expands as you plug it in the socket which holds it in place to maintain a secure connection.
Features
PlugTight provides 3 amps. of charging current to quickly charge your devices.  Most other chargers only handle between 1 and 2.1 amps.
Easy to Remove
Simply pull the release collar and PlugTight comes out of the socket when you are ready.

Manufacturing
Affordable pricing is important to PlugTight. To achieve this goal a large initial production run is required to reduce the costs of the molded plastic parts.
Our Story
We have been working hard for over a year and a half now to develop PlugTight. Along the way, we have developed partnerships to help fill in our knowledge and skill gaps. This process has taken us through 3 iterations of our design. What this means for our backers is that not only have we brought PlugTight to a high level of functionality, but we have also taken the time to design for manufacturability. These prototype iterations have also given us the opportunity to test out our supply chain and avoid unreliable suppliers before they become a problem in production. This has also given us the time to seek out as many components as we can that are made here in the USA, and to find local contractors.
Is File Security Really Necessary?
There are those whose lives revolve around making things secure for other people. There are those who are completely oblivious to security concernsâ€“living life as if in a glass bubble. Unfortunately, being naive to the potential security dangers will not protect you from harm, just as ignorance to the law of gravity will not stop you from falling off a cliff.
People have welcomed cloud-based storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive and iCloud readily with little to no concern for security. Of course, measures have been taken to add a level of security, but there are many holes remaining. Skilled hackers can easily penetrate those holes and expose your personal data. Also, there is always the question of who has access to that data. Do you know?
The only way to truly protect your files is to encrypt any file you place on the cloud before it arrives. My Easy File Encrypt was designed specifically for this purpose and to do it easily and automatically.
We know that security can be an arduous task. We donâ€™t want to create drudgery for you, so we designed My Easy File Encrypt to work the way you work. It should be easy to use and not disrupt your normal flow. By making My Easy File Encrypt operate with either drag and drop functionality or right-click in Windows Explorer, nothing could be easier.
You specify the folder where encrypted files should goâ€“usually your cloud storage folderâ€“and your file is automatically encrypted before being placed in that folder. You also specify where decrypted files should go and your encrypted files are decrypted before being placed in the decrypt folder.
The free version shows exactly how this works. Try it! Go to http://myeasyfileencrypt.com to download your free copy.
Even though My Easy File Encrypt was created to address the problem with the cloud, it can also be used to encrypt files before placing on flash drives or other portable storage devices. If your data files can be exploited in any way, you need to protect them. My Easy File Encrypt can provide that protection easily.
All versions of My Easy File Encrypt will be distributed by download. The download is a Windows-based application that resides on your computer or computers.
The subscriptions use a server to store the needed data for registering each computer and other account information. Since the software communicates directly with the server, all data is encrypted before being sent to the server and encrypted again before being stored. We want to be ultra sure that your data is secure.
All consumer subscription versions of My Easy File Encrypt allow use on up to 5 computers with unlimited passwords. You register each computer with the software. Any password you create on one computer is shared with the other computers so each computer can decrypt files created on any of the other registered computers.

All business subscription versions of My Easy File Encrypt require an individual be specified as the manager of the license. The manager defines computers, users, teams and the organization. Computers are assigned to users and users are assigned to teams. Users specify who can decrypt a fileâ€“only a specific user or users, members of a team or teams, or the entire organization.
When a user leaves employment at an organization, that user can be disabled from further decrypting any encrypted files.

Some of Many Articles on Breached Security
Your files will be protected from malicious hackers with My Easy File Encrypt!
FAQ
Q: How can I identify a document that is encrypted by My Easy File Encrypt?
A: All documents encrypted by My Easy File Encrypt use the same file name as the original document with the new extension of .myezenc appended to the end.

Q: What kind of encryption is used in My Easy File Encrypt?
A: My Easy File Encrypt uses a combination of industry standard and proprietary encryption algorithms to protect your files. Because the field of security is ever changing and hackers are so smart, we do not reveal our secrets. However, we will say that our algorithms are built to adapt to the changing needs of the industry, which is why the subscriptions provide the highest level of security.

Q: Can My Easy File Encrypt be used to encrypt files on my own computer?
A: Absolutely. You can also use My Easy File Encrypt to encrypt to a flash drive or external driveâ€“anywhere you can specify a folder.

Q: Why canâ€™t I decrypt a file after changing the fileâ€™s name?
A: Each file that is encrypted by My Easy File Encrypt uses multiple layers of encryption. One of those layers includes the original name of the file. If the file name is changed, you will not be able to decrypt the file.

Q: What is different with My Easy File Encryptâ€™s encryption versus the encryption by cloud-storage services?
A: There are several differences. The major difference is where the encryption takes place. With cloud-storage services, the encryption takes place (if at all) after the document is transferred. With My Easy File Encrypt, the encryption takes place on your own computer before the document is transferred. Therefore, the protection you receive from My Easy File Encrypt provides much greater security.

Q: How secure is the â€œRemember my password on this computerâ€ feature in My Easy File Encrypt?
A: Security is always based upon the entry points and who has access to those entry points. If your computer is used by you alone and the computer is password protected with a strong password, then you should be safe to use the â€œRemember my password on this computerâ€ feature. However, if your computer is stolen or becomes controlled by someone else, there are tools available to allow someone to break into your computer. You need to decide how much risk you are willing to take.

Q: Can I change the password on the free version?
A: No.
Q: What if I forget my password?
A: With the free and one-time fee versions of My Easy File Encrypt, there is no way to recall your password if you forget it, which is one of the reasons why the subscription versions offer better security. With the subscriptions, you can have unlimited passwords. You only need to use the latest password to log into the program. If you forget the latest password, then you can answer a series of questions to reset your password. The answers to the series of questions are established when you setup your subscription. No employees of MyEasySoftware, Inc. will ever know your passwords.

Q: Do we need to share passwords with the business subscription?
A: No. You should never share your passwords. Instead, you specify who has access to a specific document, then the recipients use their own password to open. The My Easy File Encrypt system manages all the passwords internally.
The list of sites passwords getting hacked is never ending. Recently, we've seen Adobe, LinkedIn, eBay, and just a couple of days ago, CNet. Millions and millions of passwords hacked. Your told all the time, to use difficult passwords and make different passwords for every site. Most people don't, but even when you do, these companies are not protecting your data. 
Big sites like Cupid's dating websites stored millions of passwords in plain text, letting hackers start an immediate attack on all users of the site. In 2012 Yahoo had password breaches where they stored the passwords in plain text! 
Even when passwords are hashed, many companies are using old techniques or not using salt or other best practices to prevent privacy breaches. In 2012 also, LinkedIn was hacked and their passwords were hashed with an old algorithm but they used no salt. While hashing passwords slows down hackers a little, technology now allows for the hackers to decipher in most cases a majority of users passwords in a matter of hours.
I am not asking you to be a security expert and understand this to support this kickstarter! On the contrary. This is for the average user who wants to be safer on the internet. There can only be so much a user can do to protect themselves and their privacy online. It falls on the operators that are making profits on their users to adequately protect their users privacy and data.
Here is what I plan to do with the funds:
Create a website for the project. Name of the project and domain, TBD (and will allow suggestions from backers!)
Create, with input from a panel or board, best policies and practices for websites to protect password and user data. 
Create cross platform, cross language, open sourced code based on the policies created.
Allow websites to pledge to use the best practices and policies and to proudly let users know that they value not only their business, but their privacy and security as well. 
The best polices and practices will touch on at minimum:
Password Policy - Lengths, Characters, Complexity Password 
Storage - Salt, Hashing, Eventual breach 
Password Recovery - Security Questions, Password Transmission TLS, 2FA, phone, email, etc 
CSRF mitigation, reauthentication 
Failed logins - Lockouts based on IP, not account, Captcha's on per account if slow down is required,  Warning email to user on failed attempts,  View list of last used IPs 

Please see my Update #1 of why I finally started this project if you'd like to know more!
Our current website does not represent our goal product and may not work right until the official launch. The sole purpose of the website is to release public testing versions.
David and Jimmy started Lockin so users from around the world could upload files quickly and not have to be worried about prying eyes.
The 10,000 dollar goal for Lockin is so we can set up our servers and put apps on the Play Store and Apple Store for free. Donating to Lockin will also give you some awesome merchandise.
We pledge to keep your data safe, secure and offer you the most up to date security protocols and not sacrifice ease of use and design. Are you ready to join the Lockin?
So now your probably wondering how exactly will Lockin work when its finished. We want users to upload a file and set a time limit and download limit for each file. After the time or download limit is reached the file and data associated with it is deleted forever (unlike other companies who store your files after you deleted them) because we believe that users should have 100% control over their data. We will have some type of secure account database where you can control all of your live files and track there statistics, while staying anonymous to organizations that may want to steal or sell data. We believe that having a lot of security shouldn't make it harder for anyone to use the service, so we are designing a clean and simple interface to go along with the secure back-end of Lockin.
We are working on testing versions https://lckin.com. We will be releasing updates to the service every month or so until we become stable.

EZ FLIP BAG
It's important to keep your computers secure. At home, you want to insure that your children, friends or guests can't access your personal information, make unauthorized purchases or visit inappropriate web sites. At work, it's important to protect your computer from access by unauthorized co-workers, cleaning crews, and so on.
Passwords have been around since ancient times. "Open Sesame" opened the door of the robbers' den in Ali Baba and the Forty Theives. In today's technologically advanced world, passwords are still the most common method used to secure our computers, even though stories of password theft are in the news all the time.
The problem with passwords is the same now as it has always been: a password that is easy to remember is usually easy to guess. And once someone guesses your password, you've got trouble.
A secure password is make up of a sequence of characters, digits and symbols that have no inherent meaning and therefore cannot be "guessed". However, it is very difficult for the human brain to remember secure passwords. It's also difficult for people to keep track of passwords that continually change, perhaps because of a password policy at work that periodically requires you to change your password. For these reasons, people often resort to this:
Even if you don't have trouble remembering strong passwords, someone can be watching over your shoulder or a rogue program can be capturing your keystrokes.
Fingerprints are a much better alternative to passwords.  A high quality fingerprint reader provides strong security for your computer, and it's much easier and quicker to swipe your finger than it is to remember and type in a complex password.
However, securing your computer against unauthorized use requires more than just making it difficult for someone else to log in.  After you've logged into your computer, anyone can access it.  When you walk away, even for a short time, someone else can easily gain access.
What if your computer automatically locked itself within seconds after you walked away from it?  
ProxLok is more than just a fingerprint reader! ProkLok determines your proximity to your computer by establishing a connection to your cell phone after you log in, and then continually monitors that connection.
When ProxLok detects that your cell phone has moved away from the computer, it automatically locks the computer. Your cell phone can remain in your pocket or purse, and ProxLok does not interfere with the operation of your cell phone in any way.
If you don't happen to have your cell phone with you, no worries. After you log in, ProxLok will warn you that it can't detect your cell phone and ask if you want it to periodically request a fingerprint scan in order to keep you logged in. Or, you can just use the warning as a reminder that you left your cell phone behind somewhere, and go retrieve it.
If you want even more security, ProxLok can be configured to periodically request a fingerprint scan even when it detects your cell phone, just in case you're prone to leaving your cell phone behind.
All of these features and more can be configured to your liking, so you can get the balance of convenience and security that fits your needs.
Additional Benefits
Protecting your computer against unauthorized use is certainly important. But what about all those web sites you visit that require passwords?
There seems to be no end to the news stories about yet another company's servers being hacked and passwords stolen. You should never use the same password on more than one web site, no matter how complex the password is.
Password managers, such as LastPass and Roboform, provide an easy way for you to use strong passwords for the web sites you use without having to remember any of them.  However, they require you to create a "master" password to protect the list of stored passwords.
This presents the same dilemma as your Windows log in password, if not worse. If your master password is easy to guess, all your stored passwords are vulnerable (and conveniently organized in one place for whoever is stealing them).  If your master password is complex, then it's difficult to remember and cumbersome to type in all the time.  Even if it's complex, someone can look over your shoulder or spy on you and see what you're typing.
ProkLok solves this problem as well. Both RoboForm and LastPass can easily be configured to use a fingerprint reader instead of asking for the master password.  By configuring a very secure master password that you don't have to remember and using your fingerprint to access your web password manager, your web passwords are highly secure!
Once ProxLok is installed, the RoboForm and LastPass master password requests look like this:
Windows 10
Microsoft understands the problem, and introduced the Windows Biometric Framework in Windows 7. They're taking it to the next level in Windows 10 with "Windows Hello". You can read about that here: http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/17/making-windows-10-more-personal-and-more-secure-with-windows-hello/.
ProxLok will be fully compatible with Windows Hello.
Even with these advances, Windows Hello doesn't address the issue of your computer being vulnerable once you've logged in, and then walk away. But we've got that covered with our patented technology.
ProxLok works with Windows 7, 8 and 10 (please see below for system requirements).
Still Not Sure?

Future Plans / Stretch Goals
In addition to detecting the presence of your cell phone, we will also be looking into the ability to detect smart watches. We also will be looking into detecting Bluetooth-enabled tags as an alternative to detecting your cell phone.  This option may be more attractive for business users.  We'll keep you posted as our R&D progresses.

The impact of high profile security breaches resulting in massive data losses has been felt by major companies and organizations worldwide, resulting in huge financial losses, reputational losses and in some cases bankruptcy. However, the greatest impact is felt by the average consumer whose personally identifiable information gets breached while in the custody of these enterprises.
The recent Apple iCloud "photo leaks" of nude pictures of 100+ celebrities bring this point home, however you don't need to be a celebrity to be a target of hackers stealing your sensitive data stored in the cloud!
According to a recent industry study, LinkedIn, Google+, Twitter and Facebook and other cloud service users had the highest incidence of fraud. This is no surprise because criminals can use your sensitive information obtained from hacking these cloud services to commit financial fraud.
I founded CloudeAssurance, Inc. 3 years ago as a spin-off of my 12-year old Cyber Security Management company called eFortresses, with one goal - to enable the safe and secure adoption of cloud computing.
We successfully raised $500K USD seed investment from a private investor in June 2012 just 3 months after we launched our cloud security rating SaaS platform and we signed our first paying customer in July 2012.
We were one of 4 vendors that made the 2013 Gartner Cool Vendor in Risk Management and Compliance out of 400 vendors that were nominated for this coveted award.
With a handful of paying customers for our SaaS platform, we successfully raised an additional $300K USD seed investment from our existing investor in May 2014 and this allowed us to innovate once again by developing and launching a consumer focused cloud security monitoring app - AlertApp! in Google Play in August 2014 and Apple Store (iTunes) in September 2014.
To attract additional capital from private equity firms, corporate or pure-play VCs next year, we need to raise $200K USD by December 31.
We are now counting on consumers like you that store sensitive data in cloud services such as Google cloud, Apple iCloud, Box.com, Dropbox, Microsoft Cloud, Amazon Cloud etc to utilize our innovative mobile app, to protect your data in the cloud, by backing us through Kickstarter in exchange for 1 year AlertApp! Mobile App subscription for up to 5 users.
The project Summer of Security is to deliver real-world security to High School students, or students who are entering college or whom have an interest in the field of information security, and or technology. The primary focus is to educate users on the dangers of information leakage, and improper usage of security tools, and options within security software as well as server-side technologies.
Our classes will demonstrate not only how to enforce good security policies and security measures but what happens when the time is not taken in order to secure a service, or harden a system from attacks. The mitigation strategies are taken from an easy approach to a full blown hardened system that will require additional methods in order to break.
After each student understands how to implement security he or she will then be able to play capture the flag against each corresponding team (20-30 students per class) with access to an instructor while they are performing the capture the flag labs.
Students will also learn to perform penetration tests, and understand the process that corporations will require for testing security and in what fashion the tests will be performed. 
Why support this project??
My business partner, Mr. Kim Yager came to me in late 2012 with the idea for a universal, modular, adjustable, flexible tablet holder. I thought he was crazy. I mean, a holder that can do all of that; is sitting on store shelves; and is under $50 MSRP. I thought he was crazy. 
We both lost our fathers within a couple years of each other and at the time I thought maybe it was just how we grieved. After much deliberation and brain-storming we agreed that we should do something GREAT with the monies that we received from our fathers estates. Not wasting it away, investing it into a dream.
My dad always told me that I should develop an iOS app (I'm a software developer by day) - I simply don't have the time (or resources to do that)... this resonated in my mind... what if the idea that Kim dreamed up was a means to the end of long 60-90 hour work weeks, hour long (one-way) commutes, more family time, the ability to take our kids to school, not worrying about rushing home to get to sports practices and school functions. A way to live life and not just survive day to day, week to week.
I tell ya folks, I'm not rich (if I was I wouldn't be on here), but Kim and I spent many late nights away from our wives and kids while also working our day jobs developing this product so that YOU could benefit from the usability of our FlexMount.
Our FlexMount is providing consumers a comfortable, natural way of using their tablets, e-readers, and mobile devices. Want to watch a movie but don't want a crick in your neck from looking down into your lap? Want to start the movie in the living room; then dis-mount and move to a mount in your bedroom? Do you enjoy streaming music through an online service? Do you want to make that streaming experience a fluid one from home to car to work and back again? Would you want to secure your device so that it isn't laying around to have coffee spilled on; or to slide around in the passenger seat? How distracting! You have this device you have spent hundreds or thousands of dollars on just to have it unsecured?!? 
Kim and I have dreamed up this product in my office in Crawfordsville, IN (a small community about 1 hour west of Indianapolis). After investing nearly $30k of our own monies we developed our product! The FlexMount. What a great feeling when it arrived, packaged, ready for retail sale.. Our Project picture is the day they arrived.
FlexMount Tablet Holder
Kim is a salesman. So, he started doing what he does best. We developed the product together, I worked with our designer and helped design the box, we worked with our photographer on product photos. I mean, we spent a lot of time and effort on this. This isn't something we are starting, WE ARE READY TO SELL! Ok, so I mentioned, Kim is a salesman; This should be easy, right?! WRONG! We were met with roadblock upon roadblock. We didn't have the face of a large corporation, the time for sales meetings, the sales force, or most importantly; the connections to bring our dream to the market-place.
This is where our project stalls... All progress halted. That was in late 2014 / early 2015. In August of 2015 we started talking with a company about becoming our marketing partner. They have the sales force, the time for meetings and MOST IMPORTANTLY; yep you guessed it, the connections.
The purpose of this Kickstarter project is to mobilize our marketing partner and get this product to the market place. We are targeting stores like BestBuy, Walmart, Target, Kohls, Amazon, Fryes, Radio Shack, and lots lots more. Big box stores. Not mom-and-pop shops (though them too!). 
In order to get the ball rolling we have worked out a deal with the marketing company that we can front-load their commission and they have a guaranteed pay-back option, which will re-imburse us for the initial investment to get the team mobilized. We are hoping to start putting our product into stores in late 2015 (before the holiday season) or early 2016. 
We have already manufactured and packaged 1,000 of the FlexMount Tablet Holders and are ready to get them out of our warehouse.
We are offering some really awesome rewards for our Kickstarter project, probably more than we can really afford to, but if we only break-even building our business model for the first year we are really okay with this.
The problem our product addresses:
Based upon our research we have identified that there is a lack of flexible, adjustable, modular, and easily install-able tablet, e-reader and mobile device mounts in the current retail market place. With the ever-growing popularity of tablet and mobile devices this problem will continue to grow. Our FlexMount products solve this problem.
Our product ideas and versions:
The Standard version of the FlexMount Tablet Holder provides consumers with a portable, easily install-able tablet / e-reader / mobile device holder. The Standard version of the FlexMount Tablet Holder is the perfect addition to your everyday travel or office routine. It comes equipped with our signature Tongue Mount and Clamp Mount as well as our Flexible Arm and Spring Holder. Everything you need to enhance your daily routine in one easy box! This version also supports most (but not all) smart phone and mp3 player devices. The FlexMount Tablet Holder gives consumers the ability to clamp a gooseneck arm to a piece of furniture (e.g. desk, table, countertop, headboard, etc.) or they can utilize the tongue mount for easy installation into their car or truck. Need one at home and in your vehicle? Just add an additional spring-holder and you now have two fully functional - modular â€“ stands that can be used virtually anywhere.

Can you help us?
This is our working prototype, a scaled down version of this Projects Campaign
    In Phase 1 of the Cubes project, we were aiming toward a small Cube to power small cabins or homes. Phase 2 is bigger and better. The Cube System in Phase 2 will power homes or shops with larger electrical needs.
Decades ago, I was looking into alternative energy sources that could compete with utility companies for providing electric. Back then, there were no tax incentives, nor were solar products even close to being reasonably priced. Today is a whole different and wonderful story! Solar products in general have came down in price nearly 50% over the past two years, promising affordable solar power to everybody who wants it. Also, Federal Tax incentives are at $3000 this year, and continue to improve as more alternative energy products are invented. These are just a few of the advantages of the "Cube" over conventional solar installed systems.
    Our "Cube" does not install onto your house, nor is it a permanent structure on your property. What does this mean to homeowners? NO new property taxes! Of course, if you decide to move, the whole system breaks down in under an hour to move with you! Wherever you go, the "Cube" system can go with you. These are a few of the advantages I wanted to see that the "Cube" has over the conventional solar installed systems.
To get started, we built the above pictured scaled down working prototype to prove the conceptual design and functionality of our main focus project, the "Cube". The current video we have is a working prototype, not the project we are trying to fund. The exterior dimensions will look similar to this first prototype, however the electrical components will be of the highest quality industry standards for solar system hardware with warranties starting at 5 years and extending up to 25 years on some parts, with lifetime warranties on workmanship and labor. Off the grid Cubes are a portable source of military tough secure electricity that will last decades, not just years. They are powered by high quality weatherproof and hail resistant photo voltaic solar panels which charge specialized high amp hour batteries, and produce clean energy for a wide span of electric needs. Ranging from a small campsite all the way up to a large industrial shop, depending on the number of modules used. They are very rugged, and meant to be transported in the back of a small trailer or pickup truck, and setup on site in under two hours. The "Cube" is built to be secure, with double concealed tamper resistant padlock construction in a heavy gauge steel weatherproof container. 
Prototype Cube solar / battery charging components
 A few outstanding features of the Cube system design:
Sound proofing acoustic foam interior for generator
Generator area completely sealed from other components
Generator option will be as quiet as a conversation
Battery area completely sealed from other components
1/2" sound absorbing rubber matt on entire Cube floor
Easy opening lid with coated cables to keep things quiet
Double padlock security for durability & peace of mind 
5" HD casters makes it easy to move on rough surfaces
Fork liftable Cube built from 16 gauge reinforced steel
Camo and other color and paint options
Weatherproof Cube system, full weatherstriped lid
Every hole is grommeted and sealed with high heat silicone
Hideaway heavy duty grab handles on both sides of Cube
All electrical components are UL listed & approved
Unparalleled 10/25 Year Warranty on Cube system *
The Cube system sets up or breaks down in under 2 hours
The Cube system is completely mobile 
Standard UL listed outlets, including standard 30 amp RV
The funds from all of our pledges to build the full scale "Cube" will be used to purchase high quality solar power components, such as a 6kw power inverter, several 305 watt photovoltaic solar panels, 6kw charge inverter / charge controller, auto generator start module, heavy steel casing for the components, several high amp hour deep cycle batteries, acoustic soundproofing foam for the optional generator section, 1/2" thick rubber padding for the base of the entire container, weatherstripping for the lid, lighting for the interior of container, steel for fabricating the frame for the solar panels, heavy copper cabling for the battery connections, copper cable ends, 2kw electric start backup generator, heavy casters to roll the container around on, camo paint pattern stencils, paint, and a breaker box to protect the charging system from short failures.

FAQ from Phase 1 of the Cube Project:
Q: How long will a Cube power a house?
 A:    The time a Cube will power a house depends on the Kw requirements of the home. If you have all gas appliances, a 6 Kw Cube system should power it every day from now on. If you have electric water heater, electric range, electric heat etc, you need a larger system, such as a 10 Kw Cube. Running energy star rated appliances, low wattage LED lighting, unplugging energy wasting devices when not in use, etc., all give you more runtime. Each Cube is built with scale-ability in mind, starting from your Kw needs, they can be upgraded to accommodate larger power requirements. Most electric bills show the total monthly Kw usage from your home or shop. From this number, we can build the right size cube system for you. Larger systems (2Kw and up) require more solar panels to charge them. You need to have enough property facing South to allow for several panels for a larger system.
Q: How many Cubes does it take to power a house?
A:    Each Cube system is built to cover a variety of power needs. One Cube system is built for the electrical needs of a small cabin, while another can supply the electrical needs of a large home or shop. The larger systems (3k and up) need room for more solar panels with ground mounts, to assist in charging the Cube during the day. A 6k Rage Cube System will power a small house with gas appliances*. A 10k Mighty Cube System will power a larger house with electrical appliances*. Cube systems also have an option for super quiet built in propane operated automatic starting and stopping generators. These generators will start and charge the system in the event that there is insufficient sun, or a failure of any kind that restricts the system from being charged by the panels. In the event of a larger power requirement, such as a large shop or business that needs more than 10Kw of power, we have a Super Cube, and options for scaleable modular Super Cubes that can be connected in tandem formation to provide up to 50Kw or more power. That is enough to run five (5) total electric homes!
* Appliances noted here are gas versus electric:
Gas appliances of course do not use electric as the main power source, thereby saving on electric use and allowing you to use a smaller Cube System to power your home or shop. So, ranges & stove tops, water heaters, heating systems, small heaters and so on, if they are gas will save you money by purchasing a smaller Cube System.
What if terrorist attack our power grids?
 SAN JOSE, Calif.â€”The attack began just before 1 a.m. on April 16 last year, when someone slipped into an underground vault not far from a busy freeway and cut telephone cables. Within half an hour, snipers opened fire on a nearby electrical substation. Shooting for 19 minutes, they surgically knocked out 17 giant transformers that funnel power to Silicon Valley. A minute before a police car arrived, the shooters disappeared into the night. To avoid a blackout, electric-grid officials rerouted power around the site and asked power plants in Silicon Valley to produce more electricity. But it took utility workers 27 days to make repairs and bring the substation back to life.
With the Cube System, it is not a problem. You still have reliable electric, everyday, 24 hours a day. What if gas goes up to a more ridiculous amount than it is already? The optional generator on the Cube System runs on propane fuel. You can store as large of a supply as you need for months or even years with a large enough tank. The optional generator rarely ever runs anyway, since the Cube System is so efficient in producing clean solar power day after day. Some things to think about. Cliff - Project Lead
Q: How much will a Cube System cost?
Here is a lineup of the Cube Systems, including costs:
200 watt Micro Cube..........$ 199.00  
1000 watt Mini Cube.......... $ 3,999.00 
3000 watt Power Cube.......$ 8,999.00 
6000 watt Rage Cube.........$ 19,999.00 
10000 watt Mighty Cube....$ 29,999.00 
20000 watt Mega Cube......$ 59,999.00
Q: * What is the battery lifespan in a Cube system?
 A:   Batteries have an average lifespan of 6-8 years in a Cube system. The Cube system delivers exactly the type of charging and correct amount of voltage at all times to keep the batteries at optimal performance levels, thereby increasing the battery life.
What is NervCell?
NervCell is a web browser dedicated to your healthcare.
The NervCell web browser will allow doctors to connect easily and share patient records. Doctors will easily build a practice-specific EMR from the NervCell App Store.
Patients will control access to their medical records, interact with providers, customize NervCell to their health needs, and have access to vastly improved searches on health topics.
NervCell is a web browser with an open platform so anyone can create apps and offer them in the NervCell App Store free or for a fee. The NervCell API will allow 3rd party applications to interface for rich user experiences.

NervCell will be easy to use for patients and doctors.
NervCell will have iPad, iPhone and Android versions also.
NervCell will make healthcare Patient-centric like it should be.
Why a Patient-centric approach?
By following a patient-centric approach, every segment of the healthcare
system benefits: patient health improves; payers reduce costs and premiums
by becoming more efficient; providers improve the quality and safety of their
clinical practice.
Patient-centric approaches have these characteristics:
Patient records, health information, procedure costs and practitioner data are made more easily available over the Internet.
Data is able to flow among system participants, including providers, physician practices, clinics and labs, and payers.
Patient and related medical information is incorporated into clinical work flows and processes, making pertinent medical information available at the point of care.
The individualâ€™s accountability for and participation in managing his or her own health and well-being increases.
Key elements of successful patient-centric healthcare models:
They involve every interested party in the healthcare chain: industry, patient, payer and provider.
Medical records and information are stored electronically for instantaneous retrievalâ€”in a highly secure environment that protects privacy and allows access only to authorized users.
The Internet plays a key role in disseminating information.
Technology standards are open, not proprietary.
Cost and performance data is available to facilitate informed choice.
The Current Approach to Health Care vs. New Way with NervCell:

Currently:  Care is based primarily on short visits to your doctor
New Way: Care is based on continuous healing relationships

Currently:  Information is a Record
New Way:  Knowledge is shared and Information flows freely, yet securely

Currently:  Do no harm is an individual responsibility
New Way:  Safety is an inherent NervCell system property

Currently:  Professionals control care
New Way:  The patient is the source of control

Currently:  The system reacts to needs
New Way:  Needs are anticipated

Currently:  Preference is given to professional roles rather than the system
New Way:  Cooperation among clinicians is a priority

Currently:  Cost reduction is sought
New Way:  Waste is continuously decreased
How will NervCell help doctors?
The top 3 reasons doctors cite for not using an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) are:

1. Their lack of capacity to select, contract and install an EMR
2. Finding an EMR that meets their needs
3. Concern that the system will become obsolete
NervCell eliminates all of these concerns.  Doctors can build a custom EMR from the NervCell App Store.  One that fits their practice needs and workflow.  Since NervCell is free there is no worry about paying for a bloated system that doesn't do what you want it to.  NervCell will never become obsolete.  You can update NervCell just like any browser by receiving update notices.  Mixing and matching Apps will give you the freedom to build a system that works for your practice.
NervCell will allow you to tap into your local HIE (Health Information Exchange) and find your patients records from all hospitals, clinics, providers and labs. You will have a complete recoed of your patient's health.
NervCell will allow you to communicate with your patients via secure email, texting, and video conferencing, resulting in improved care and increased revenue.
NervCell will facilitate "team medicine," in which doctors from different specialties work together along with scientists to treat all of a patient's needs. This type of collaboration is especially important in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease. Treatment for chronic disease accounts for 70 percent of U.S. health care spending and is one of the biggest drivers of cost. Chronic disease can cause numerous complications across medical specialties. For example, poorly managed diabetes, which costs the U.S. $22 billion a year, can affect the heart, kidneys and eyes in addition to the endocrine system.
No more vendor lock in. NervCell will have meaningful use built in!
Why a healthcare web browser?
The Internet is the key.
A patient-centric approach will only work if patients have the tools available
to make informed decisions about their own care, and if they are encouraged
to use them. Although the Internet offers a wide range of sites with medical
resources, information is often difficult to find, poorly organized or simply
inaccurate. To make well-informed medical decisions, patients need readily
accessible medical information.
How will it work?
It's simple.  Launch NervCell and it will ask you to log into your account.  Once you do that your NervCell browser has access to your medical data and can display it and manipulate it any way you want.  If you do not log in, then NervCell can be used like any browser and no one will see your personal records.
NervCell Technology
NervCell will be built with Chromium and Webkit, the open source frameworks that power Google Chrome, Apple Safari and RockMelt. NervCell will be free and customizable from the NervCell App Store for specific needs of doctors and patients. The app store will be an open platform for development for anyone with a great idea for improving healthcare.
NervCell does not store your records on the internet so there is no danger of exposing your sensitive medical records to hackers. NervCell will tap into the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) and pull your records down as easily as web pages.  The data will be in XML format so your personal NervCell browser can display the data according to the apps you have installed. The NHIN is being developed to provide a secure, nationwide, interoperable health information infrastructure that will connect providers, consumers, and others involved in supporting health and healthcare. This critical part of the national health IT agenda will enable health information to follow the consumer, be available for clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve health.  More information about NHIN.
NervCell impact
NervCell will have a disruptive influence on the Electronic Medical Records industry. Companies will be compelled to follow the paradigm shift NervCell will create or perish. They will have to switch from building proprietary systems to building modules/apps for NervCell that they can give away or sell in the NervCell App Store.
A nerve cell by itself is useless
But, if you connect many you get a system that can do amazing things.

The NervCell healthcare web browser will connect millions of doctors and patients all over the world and amazing things will happen.
"The closed-loop, proprietary analogue world is over. Only open standards will allow all parts of the healthcare industry to quickly and economically respond to changing market forces and guarantee that data can be rapidly and seamlessly accessed throughout the world." -- IBM

Phara0h Patch
Sample Client Download Link
www.jtwhissel.com/Phara0hPatchClient.exe
Free Online Software Distributing Patching and Installing Solution!
NEW VIDEO COMMING SOON! IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OLD VIDEO ITS RIGHT HERE!
Client (Sample Client):
Fast - The speed of the client will only be hindered by the speed of the server. 
Secure - Do to the fact that everything is on there server side, and the server is the one to talk to the data base, it makes it extremely secure since you will not be able to do any sql injections. 
Light - This client is only 26kb, so you can imagine how happy your customers will be when they won't have to wait to download a large file in there browser. 
Smart - It uses MD5 hashing to send to the server, to see if there are any changes that need to be done at a byte level. It only replaces tampered with files or missing ones! Nothing more, nothing less!
Server:
Universal - The code base was written in java, so if your OS supports JAVA, then you can run the server! 
Fast - It checks the MD5 hashes against a data base that it automatically updates, so it is not cluttered with unnecessary entries.(It only retains entries of files currently in your servers root folder.
Secure - With the combination of a custom protocol and MD5 checking against a DB, it's virtually a brick wall! 
Dynamic - You can say how big you want your packets to be! No more easily sniffed and cracked packets do to being a static size. This sever allows you to change your packets to be as small as 1kb to unlimited kb,mb,or gb. But you should be reasonable do to the limitations of the MTU rate of a normal router (3000kb).
Persistent - At start it does a recursive search for any files that need to be updated to the DB. Then after it is started, it will not do it again. This will prevent any hacks or over used processor expensive searching. If you want to change a file or update your software, simply just restart the server. 
Easy - The server is so easy to use, all you have to do it put everything you want the server to keep track of and distribute in one folder, or the name of the folder of your projects install folder, and let the server take care of the rest. You don't have to worry about if the names of the files are "Server Safe" or if you have to many folders. Phara0h Patch any file, folder and with any name will work!
SDK:
     Just in case my sample client did not fit your needs, I will be making tons of sdks, to make your own custom client to talk to the server. With so many SDK's to choose from you can have endless uses for this server.
Some of the languages that will be released, with your guys support will be
UDK
C++
Java
And what ever other support the community (YOU!) are asking for!
Want to try it out?!??!
Click the link below to download the client, and just run it! Keep in mind the speed of my internet is unbearably slow. (60kb upload) so if its slow, its my ISP's fault not Phara0h Patch.
Sample Client Download Link
www.jtwhissel.com/Phara0hPatchClient.exe
Now after it finishes downloading everything, you should see a folder called "Downloaded_Files". Try to edit them (Hack Them) then run the client again and see how it responds to that. Also try deleting any files in the folder or the whole folder its self and see how it responds. Notice how it only updates what it needs to!
Thank you so much for your support and don't hesitate to ask me any questions or shout out any feed back!

Jt Whissel
The idea is to create a Web Application Vulnerability Scanner that is similar in functionality to some of the enterprise application security scanners on the market right now (ex: IBM AppScan, HP WebInspect, Cenzic to name a few). There is a more exhaustive list here:
http://sectoolmarket.com/price-and-feature-comparison-of-web-application-scanners-unified-list.html
These products are very good, but the simple truth is these products are EXTREMELY expensive ($30,000 per year for 1 license, and when integrated with other features can be well over $100,000 - $300,000 per year per license).
We are a small group of application security professionals and programmers that want to create a scanner with the same feature set as the enterprise scanners that is FREE for non-commercial use, and $1,000 a year for unlimited commercial use.
Small and medium sized businesses often do not have the knowledge to properly secure the applications they deploy in their environments, and can not afford the enterprise security software products that could help them. This is the problem that we are trying to address by making something that is easy to use, affordable for small and medium sized business, and actually provides the same value that the enterprise security products do.
We have a working prototype that we have been developing for nearly a year now, and it has about 50% of the features that the enterprise products have. We have been testing our product against the same test environment used in this scanner feature comparison website as well as a few similar vulnerable test applications:
http://sectoolmarket.com/price-and-feature-comparison-of-web-application-scanners-unified-list.html
So far we are rating between the top 10-12 out the 64 scanners compared depending on the types of tests we do. We want to add the feature sets and vulnerability coverage to make us a top 5 scanner by the end of the year (competing with IBM and HP). We are currently working with 2 small banks, and 3 medium sized companies ($50-100 million in revenue size) - they are acting as beta testers helping us with bug fixes and features that they would like to see.
You can download the scanner from here:
http://strategicsec.com/products/webscannerpro/
We need to hire a few more developers, and a few more systems people to help us reach this goal. We also need to hire a technical writer and a marketing consultant.
We want to go to market with the product in the next few weeks and we need help - we've bootstrapped the development of this product for year and we need help to take the product to the next level and make something that is REALLY good for the community.
MedusaCMS is a brand spanking new CMS that is geared to the headaches that inbound marketers, developers and designers face every day. Getting calls from clients confused with a WP site? Yea we hear that! Need to deploy 10 websites today? We are here to help you get it done.

I could really use these funds to patent my invention and start building them out of the desired materials. My project is in the beginning phases i plan on improving my design by using diamond plate and adding a role out feature so the whole tool box can slide in and out.
Carry your wireless phone, tablet and i-pod more securely and conveniently with a Flip Clip. Super easy to install and use. The Flip Clip is a cross between a fashion accessory and a wireless accessory. 
You can quickly and easily attach the Flip Clip to any wireless device and most wireless cases. Remove the seal covering the 3M, super strong adhesive and press on device.  The glue dries almost immediately.
I currently design the Chatt line of fashion accessories and custom gifts. We use Swarovski crystal, Murano style, hand-paint glass and natural gemstones to decorate our Chatt fashion accessories.  Backers can select these same elements for their Flip Clip and Go Wireless in Style!
Swarovski Crystal
Murano Style Hand-Painted Glass
Natural Gemstone
Flip Clips are patent pending!  They are made of steel with a nickel finish, measure 40mm x 5mm and weigh one ounce.  We recommend applying them to wireless cases with a flat smooth surface. Many industry experts have found gel style cases provide the best protection.
 Background
Your Privacy
Communication has always been an important part of our world, especially now with the growth of technology and the various forms of communication available. However, while technology grows at an expedited rate, so do the risks that are associated with online communication. Everyday billions of people use their email accounts for personal and professional reasons and connect with others in ways that once was thought to be impossible, but no one takes the time to consider how all of these emails services work. 
The free email services that are readily available to the public are popular because they are user-friendly and have very little to no cost to use. We all become so dependent on these particular email services because that's what we have used over the years and are comfortable with. Unfortunately, we seldom take a moment to think about how these companies make their money. 
Why would such an expensive infrastructure would be offered to us for free? Did you really think that it was all about ads embedded on those services? Well we canâ€™t say itâ€™s not that, but it's for sure not only that. Actually nowadays thatâ€™s only one factor to a way bigger equation.
When the time came, email providers started to become smarter. They realized they could not only send and store our emails, but also read and analyze them. All backed up in the fact that they wanted to offer us better advertisements, as if that was what we were seeking. 
  Big Data
Big Data
What once was these email services just offering better ads, quickly turned into a whole data scrapping service, which is now called Big Data. That data stores all of our information in multiple and various databases all over the world, in a very well organized fashion. If in any way we naively wanted to query those databases, we would only get "profiles," which are essentially only a version of a persons collected data without revealing identifying information. But that doesnâ€™t mean that the identifying information is not stored, it only means that we donâ€™t have the right to see it. It is there though, stored in multiple servers and these companies are using that information that we handed right to them, because of lack of being properly informed. 
Big email providers soon became government data providers, and so governments would mix that data with credit card, insurance, health, phone communications and many other type of data. All very neatly organized and stored for when they need and or what to access it. 
But thatâ€™s not all. Being that all the data is well centralized and classified, and cloned so many times, going from sever to server, through not always secure channels, it becomes an opportunity for hackers, crooks, identity thieves and spies to get ahold of it. Even worse than big data collectors, they only want your data for malicious reasons. This unfortunately happens often because we serve the information to them so easily by not researching the online services we are using all day every day. 
 Our Solution
Liberty Mail
 LibertyMail is a private initiative that takes back what we lost: our privacy. Because before email existed, nobody read and stored our letters, faxes or phone calls and if it did happen it was for a very targeted and serious reason.
We â€” the LibertyMail teamâ€” know that this is not going to change everything and put all back in order again. Security is a continuous improvement process, rather than something that you can achieve all at once and then lay back and rest.
Just have a look at the features section on the LibertyMail website and you can see that thereâ€™s much more than what other providers usually offer. Because other encrypted emails providers offer only that: encryption. When privacy actually needs much more than only encryption. Let me enumerate just few of them:
No need of personal data to bill customers 
No storage of customers details 
Available only by invitation 
Auto-destroy feature for emails you want to 
Password protected emails 
Identity checks before email is shown to receiver 
Encrypted storage 2FA authentication (both with GA or Yubikey)
Decentralized servers based in Switzerland
When it comes to privacy, itâ€™s all about freedom: of speech, of belief, of doing or not doing and so on. So here we are adding our bricks to this building that is freedom, help us to spread the world and fund this project. Because it is not for us, it is for all people who cares about privacy and freedom. .

How do I start this?  Let me see..... In the beginning there was..?  No! Once upon a time there was..?  Nooo!  I got it!!!!  It twas the night before..? No and absolutely not.  Scratch that......
How about I just start at the beginning?  That sounds much better! 
Here's my story.....
In 2008 a retired Maryland State Trooper and now Director of Security at a major hospital took me off to the side and said "Vince you gotta do something" to help me protect all these sliding doors (there were many)! If the hospital has a major panic due to an outside public event (terrorism, fire, hazmat issue, natural disaster, airborne disease, etc.) and people rush the hospital, what can we do?  I [Vince] searched my trade magazines and wholesale catalogs for a product that may work, and reported back.  I'm sorry sir but there is nothing on the market that I can use to help you overcome this critical dilemma.  With great disappointment, he [The Director of Security] walked away.  Do understand, I [Vince] do not like to fail or disappoint a customer, especially when it comes to security and life safety.  Later that night, [personal initiative is always in full effect] I drove back to the hospital to examine his double sliding doors to come up with a solution.  After working into the night sketching and rendering out a new idea.  I made initial success on paper, at the moment!  But would my idea survive my brutally honest and merciless Patent Agent, and the professionals at the PTO who will do a worldwide historical search?  I'm sorry, failure is not an option, so I played by all the rules and remained optimistic.  Four (4) long years later, after filing in 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office determined, this is indeed a new, novel, and beneficial solution. The birth of US Patent http://www.google.com/patents/US8585105 . Something never thought of in the history of the world. [Huge celebration!!!] Please continue to follow this from conception to near reality.  [Many thanks!]
As you are aware. After the events of 9-11, the world as we used to know it was forever changed. All security measures have increased beyond the stratospheres.  Vigilance, advanced planning, and locking people in and out is the main safety direction around the world.  This statement includes a desire for faster and more efficient locking mechanisms. There is a constant, well hidden scenario the general public is not aware of. That secret is, not all doors can be locked immediately in the event of an emergency. Imagine visiting one of the following: A hospital, school, shopping mall, local drug store, large hardware store, hotel, large department store, government building, or any large or small private sector building.  Basically, any building with one, or more particular, multiple entrances.  In the wake of recent random shootings and other attacks, public  word comes across of an incident near your location. In a panic, one of reasonable sense would want to lock out any potential violence before it moves inside a building, or maybe isolate it if it's already in a building. If a hospital or mall had 37 double sliding doors to be locked, what would security do?  Let's try this one more time!  From the conception of sliding double doors (invented 60 years ago in 1954) up to the current year 2014.  What would, could, should, security personnel do?????  The answer is RUN!!! Run to use a key, to lock all 37 sliding double doors. Imagine the time and panic in concluding this process. Did you know historically and at present, the only way to lock a double sliding door is to use an old fashioned hook latch and key? Yes, it's true!  One can remotely kill power to a double door but it can still be forced open.  There is NOTHING else on the market that can lock these type doors remotely - UNTIL NOW. After hearing so many complaints about this from Directors of Security in various buildings, a new idea and patented product was born. US Patent 8.585,105 discloses the solution. The MoveNetic Magnetic Lock has the ability to lock double sliding doors at the push of one button. Meaning, instead of running to lock 37 sliding doors as previously mentioned, one can do so instantly!  What makes this product work so efficiently? Simply, all magnetic locks are designed to be mounted to a stable, non-movable surface. Because all double sliding doors move away from each other. It is physically impossible to use this type lock or anything similar on these doors. [Curtain call for the MoveNetic Magnetic Lock]  Existing magnetic locking technologies will work on a single sliding door because the door slides towards the frame holding the door.  Not double sliding doors.   The MoveNetic lock allows both the magnetic lock (which in the past had to be mounted on a stable frame) and the strike plate to both move. Thus allowing remote locking of both doors immediately. Here's a fair question. So both doors are locked at the press of a button? What if the lock looses power? Answer - it won't. The lock is connected to a power supply with battery backup. Thus, if the primary power is loss, the batteries will keep the door(s) locked for many hours to come depending on the batteries installed. So Vince, how big is the market for this product?  Close your eyes and try to count how many sliding doors there are in every city in the United States.  How about, how many double sliding doors are on the planet? Good luck with that thought!!!!  I'm truly sorry to blow your mind with the thought [let's both reach for the Excedrin together] but let's agree it's a huge market.  Let's give some fair estimates. There may be approximately 400+ million doors [low estimate] of this type just in this country alone, and zero devices [official] to protect them instantly except this one product. Let's say it out loud together.  THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF DOORS!!!! Imagine the possibilities. 
.....Keeping People In Is My Next Important Topic
Two more thoughts to consider.  I have discussed keeping people out but how about me explaining more real time scenarios?  Scenario 1 revolves around child theft.  What if someone tried to steal a baby from the same hospital as mentioned earlier?  Typically, are new born's are kept well inside the hospital.  If a situation arises where a child may be missing, one can instantly lock down the entire facility until the child is recovered. Thus, stopping the exit and passage of everyone in the building. 
Scenario 2 might be a shopping store or similar and a child is suddenly missing. Or the potential for an abduction comes to the forefront.  The child does not respond to repeated pages on the store's intercom and the parents are going crazy searching!!!  Once again, instantly lock the store down to keep all parties in until the search is completed, and the child is found. This is a must have to match the type world we now live in. 
The goal is to finish the prototyping development phase and travel to different companies in a similar industry to offer licensing rights.  If this does not go as planned then seek out a manufacturing partnership.  To keep moving forward with the project and not hold my breath waiting on others. I would be interested in forming a company and going into full development and manufacturing, setting up distribution, exciting those at trade shows, selling to the government and any other positive means to get this into the marketplace.  Review and enjoy the video for a complete understanding of this dynamic new product and its current direction. Let's be safer together!  Your consideration is truly appreciated and honored.

The patented linear power strip is the key that makes this work: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nynro9hq40nt83p/E_shaped_Mechanism_Previz_vr01.mp4?dl=0
Our selected engineering company in Garland, Texas has started phase one of the prototyping for this project.  This will not only include the finished product using the patented locking sequence but will demonstrate in operation on a sliding glass door.  The lock is in the foreground.  Presented is the beginning design of the glass door for the lock.  The linear power strip has been designed using CAD and is being made to meet UL standards. As we present this product once completed. We can apply the usual field voltage of 12 to 24VDC and demonstrate it's locking ability.  Note: The locking force of this lock ranges from 600 to 1500 pounds.

Barter and offer anything you want. Want to pay cash? Paypal? Swap away some old "junk" from the attic? Go ahead! As long as the person you are bartering with wants it and you feel comfortable with the trade, nearly anything is fair trade (local, state and federal restrictions apply). 
Barter to either ship items or meet in person! If you donâ€™t feel comfortable meeting in person, or distance becomes a problem, you can select an option that states the item(s) will be shipped and all appropriate shipping information will be swapped and tracked.
At this point, you may be asking questions about costs. Obviously, there are operating expenses, but we believe that this type of service should be offered to users for free. We believe we have created a solution to meet the needs of everyone. Every user will be given 10 free transaction credits every month, which expires by the monthâ€™s end. These credits are your key to accepting a purchase, sale or swap. BOTH participants must have 1 credit to initiate the transaction. You can list your items for free. You can barter and hash out the details of the transaction absolutely free. But when it comes time to accept payment or agree to the transaction, both participants must have 1 credit. If you do not have any more credits, you can purchase more using the in-app-purchase feature. Unlike the free credits acquired every month, credits that are purchased do not expire. Credits can be purchased for as little as $1.00 and as much as $2.00. The price will be determined based on which Credit package is chosen.
With your support today, you will be rewarded with extra monthly credits. For example, users that spend $10 through the in-app-purchase feature will receive 5 credits. That is a one-time purchase for non-recurring credits. By supporting us through KickStarter, for $10, you will receive 5 extra monthly credits for one year!
 
We have started to develop a secure plate form to have the ability to control any output in your home,office with a 3D graphic plate form . The design is 3D graphic and illustrated with logo design, like a light push on it and it shuts the light off or on, open your garage door from anywhere in the world with a simple internet hook up , do the same to any input. The plate form is install on any OS and is able to control any input you program. We are developing the software plate form only no Hardware. How you say threw Ethernet protocols, we have 98% of all protocols like bosh, Panasonic,Sony, Samsung, LG, Pioneer, Toshiba, Ect... think of it like a universal remote when you program the remote you point and enter a code and the control is now in the new remote we integrate these codes into our plate form and like the old phrase say plug and play. Also when the software is finish we will have an instruction manual online for free download and we also have a support technician to help in any case. There is no hardware development needed. Another example is if you have a old model garage door opener and it as no TCI / IP protocol then you would need a TCI / IP converter with I / O to physically wire the converter onto the motor to then have the TCI / IP protocol that are example that you will find in the manual. Here is an illustration of a simple design:
Here is where we are with the development and what we have to do followed by time line:
Check points:
1- Create a generic plate form design.
2- Research and draw all necessary logo's for the illustration of the input      points on the plate form.
3- Engineer all contacts from the input to the logo's of desired control    points.
4- develop, integrate all points, contact and logo to write into a data base  to keep all logs of every alarm and also a registry.
5- Test and finalize the plate form and ready to disburse.
We are at the half way point of number 3, we estimate 3 months to be able to complete all necessary steps illustrated above.
Also see images below of our team developing a plate form and also other example of the plate form.
Hello, we are raising funds to make you one of the first to own a Twistafit Turn On, in one of many colors. After a lot of hard work, the design of the Twistafit Turn On for your smart phone is complete and the manufacturing of the mold is in progress. We are very close to being able to offer you a Twistafit in multiple colors. We'd like to be able to offer those colors by Christmas 2015, along with a Mag-Stand for increased support. If we meet or exceed our goal, we will send you a Twistafit in a requested color for Christmas 2015.
Note: Some color limitations apply and the Twistafit Turn On, while not currently available on the market ; may become available outside of Kickstarter prior to the Kickstarter campaign completion.
Mission:
The mission of Favorfloat is to influence a world where compassion reigns: a world where we donâ€™t see our kindness in helping other people as self-sacrifice, but instead as the opportunity to feel human.
What Is Favorfloat:
Favorfloat is a place where friends, loved ones, coworkers and people in other close relationships come to find some sense of security when they feel the compassion to loan money to friends, loved one, or co-workers who are temporarily down on their luck.
They Say Donâ€™t Lend To Friends Or Loved Ones:
We have all heard the horror stories illustrating why we should not loan money to friends, relatives, and people we are in relationships with, because they wonâ€™t pay back, thereby causing friction that ends the relationship. This is an intellectual point of view. We are humans. If we care about our friends, lovers, brothers, sisters, and our co-workers, the fact that a relationship exists, between you and a friend, between you and a relative, or between you and a loved one, creates an obligation to help in accordance with how deep your pockets are. Whether or not they will pay you back is secondary, unless you have helped that person before and they did not make good on their promise to pay you back. It is also unfair to use the bad experience you had with one person as a basis of making a decision about whether or not to help another friend with dire money needs. A relationship, whether it is friendship, romantic, or family based, must accept some kind of vulnerability to lose to the relationship. In the absence of such vulnerability, the friendship or relationship or whatever it is, is only an empty shell. Better to be alone than have such friends or be involved in any such relationship. That is why Dr. Jegede said, â€œour dearest one is not the person who mercifully gives you tissues to wipe away your tears, but one who attempts to stop your hardship from rising to the point of tears.â€
Security is hard. We want to make it easy for everyone to use best practices in the protection of their data and privacy.
Gymyli's LOC provides a technical solution to a political problem: namely, warrant-less spying by government agencies. As Americans and believers in the Rights afforded by our Constitution, we are appalled by the erosion of the rights of privacy afforded by the 1st, 4th and 5th Amendments and we further believe that all peoples everywhere should enjoy these same protections against unreasonable search and the suppression of free speech.
We bring our 20 years of Internet security expertise to bear on the challenge of providing to a non-technical audience an easy to implement, easy to use virtual private server to provide personal cloud services to you beyond the watchful eye of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo, and Apple, your ISP, LEOs, and spy agencies.
Your LOC secure private server provides:
Secure email hosting. 
Secure storage. 
VPN Services. 
Anonymous surfing
Strong, end-to-end encryption
 The solution is designed as an undesirable target for hackers and spy agencies by providing a high difficulty, low ROI target for their efforts. Gaining access to one person's data is not the success model hackers and spy agencies are currently enjoying as they leverage targets like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Home Depot, Target, JPMorgan/Chase (to name a few). Specifically, we incorporate the following goals in design and development: 
 A tiny attack surface with limited attack vectors 
Resilient software, automatically and continuously patched as new vulnerabilities are discovered 
Intrusion detection to alert the user of attempted breaches 
Comprehensive audit and access controls 
No path for hosting vendor to breach system security to gain access to your data 
Limited or no logging of service activity 
Gymyli LOC is a virtual machine, built on open source software, hardened to Center for Internet Security Benchmark standards and beyond, running in Amazon's cloud. The domain is yours, the services are yours and the keys to the kingdom are yours and yours alone. 
Gymyli LOC provides summary emails to you about all activity on your system so you know if nefarious activity is being attempted. 
We will use these funds to further our development progress and to make the process of creating a maximum security environment for your data and communications very user-friendly, lowering the technical bar for the user to take control of their online life. We will also make it possible for Gymyli to run with other virtual infrastructure providers around the world. 
We will provide training to you, our user, to achieve a high level of security on your local machines from which you will VPN into your Personal Cloud to utilize the
Email server  
File storage 
Anonymous web browsing 
All with full, end-to-end STRONG encryption to which you, and ONLY you, hold the keys. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
