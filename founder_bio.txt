Biography
As a Dive Shop Manager by day and a Programmer and Developer at night; I've seen friends and co-workers get "hacked", or their credit cards stolen or emails and passwords compromised while online. So I decided to to do something.
So I research, tested and consulted with some of the world‰Ûªs best programmers and we decided that something had to be done to protect your privacy. Each one of them brought to the table their own unique browser(s) & software, that gives you a variety of options for controlling your Privacy or the amount of information you want to be "Public" while online.
The browsers in the Armory give you the ability to Stay Private and Secure while online, by hiding your IP address, with a secure VPN, to full proxy controls, to erasing what websites you visit & online Browsing habits, or having the software automatically cloaked everything about you.
Defend your Privacy!
"Suit Up" with Web Armory 2.0 portable Software!
